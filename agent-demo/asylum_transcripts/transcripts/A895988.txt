INTERVIEW BEGINS

OFFICER: Good morning. My name is Officer Miller, and I'm an asylum officer with USCIS. Thank you for coming in today. This is an interview regarding your application for asylum in the United States. I need to inform you that you have the right to have an attorney or representative present during this interview, but I understand you’ve chosen to proceed without one, is that correct?

APPLICANT: Yes, that is correct. I understand.

OFFICER: Okay. I need to place you under oath. Please raise your right hand and repeat after me: "Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?"

APPLICANT: I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God.

OFFICER: Thank you. Before we begin, I want to explain the purpose of this interview. I will be asking you questions about your background, your reasons for leaving El Salvador, and why you fear returning. Your answers will help me determine if you meet the legal requirements for asylum. I will also assess your credibility during this interview. Do you understand?

APPLICANT: Yes, I understand.

OFFICER: Alright, let's start with some background information. What is your full name?

APPLICANT: My full name is Alex Rodriguez.

OFFICER: And you identify as non-binary?

APPLICANT: Yes, that's correct.

OFFICER: Okay. Can you tell me about your education history in El Salvador?

APPLICANT: Well, I… I didn't really finish school. I only went to, like, the equivalent of maybe seventh grade. I had to… to work.

OFFICER: Okay. You indicated on your application that you have professional experience in the legal field. Can you elaborate on that?

APPLICANT: Yes, um, I worked… I worked with a lawyer. I helped him.

OFFICER: What kind of work did you do for the lawyer?

APPLICANT: I would… file papers. And sometimes… research. Legal research.

OFFICER: And how long did you work in this capacity?

APPLICANT: About… two years. Maybe a little less.

OFFICER: Okay. Now, let's talk about why you left El Salvador. You stated in your application that you fear persecution based on your gender identity. Can you tell me more about that?

APPLICANT: Yes. Being non-binary in El Salvador is… dangerous. People… they don’t understand. They… they are not accepting.

OFFICER: Can you give me specific examples of how you were mistreated or threatened?

APPLICANT: Yes. Um… people would call me names. Like… slurs. And they would… stare. It made me feel very uncomfortable.

OFFICER: Can you give me specific examples of the slurs used?

APPLICANT: (Hesitates) Um… “maricón.” And… other things. Things I don’t want to repeat.

OFFICER: Okay. Did you ever report these incidents to the police?

APPLICANT: No. What’s the point? They wouldn’t do anything. They probably agree with the people harassing me.

OFFICER: Did you experience any physical violence or threats of physical violence?

APPLICANT: Yes. One time… a group of guys… they followed me home. They yelled things at me. And then… one of them pushed me. I fell down. I scraped my knee.

OFFICER: When did this happen?

APPLICANT: About… six months before I left. So… maybe… February of this year.

OFFICER: Where did this happen? Be specific.

APPLICANT: It was… near my house. On Calle Aurora, in San Salvador.

OFFICER: You said "a group of guys." Can you describe them? How many were there?

APPLICANT: There were… four, I think. Maybe five. They were… young. Like… my age. Wearing… normal clothes. Jeans and t-shirts.

OFFICER: Did you recognize any of them?

APPLICANT: No. I had never seen them before.

OFFICER: Did they say anything specific that indicated they were targeting you because of your gender identity?

APPLICANT: Yes! They were yelling… things like… “faggot.” And… “you deserve this.”

OFFICER: Did you seek medical attention for your scraped knee?

APPLICANT: No. It was just a scrape. I cleaned it myself.

OFFICER: Were there any other incidents of physical violence or threats?

APPLICANT: No. That was the worst one. But… there were other times when people would… threaten me. With their eyes. You know?

OFFICER: I understand. Did you ever try to relocate within El Salvador to a safer area?

APPLICANT: No. I didn't have the money. And… where would I go? It’s the same everywhere.

OFFICER: You mentioned working for a lawyer. Did you ever discuss your situation with him? Did he offer any advice or assistance?

APPLICANT: No. He… he wasn’t the type of person you could talk to about that kind of thing. He was… very traditional.

OFFICER: What other factors contributed to your decision to leave El Salvador?

APPLICANT: The gangs. They are everywhere. They control everything. They would… demand money. Extortion. Even if you don’t have anything.

OFFICER: Did the gangs ever directly target you?

APPLICANT: Not… directly. But… they were always around. You could feel the danger.

OFFICER: You mentioned your family. What is your family situation?

APPLICANT: I live with my mother. And my younger brother.

OFFICER: Are they aware of your gender identity?

APPLICANT: My mother… knows. But she doesn’t… understand. She tries. But… it’s hard for her. My brother… I don’t think he knows.

OFFICER: Are they at risk because of your gender identity?

APPLICANT: I don’t know. Maybe. I worry about them. That's why I want to get asylum, to bring them here.

OFFICER: What supporting evidence did you submit with your application to support your claims?

APPLICANT: I submitted… a statement from my friend. She… she saw some of the harassment. And… I submitted… some pictures. Of… me.

OFFICER: Pictures of what?

APPLICANT: Just… pictures of me. Showing… how I present myself.

OFFICER: Did you submit any police reports, medical records, or any other documentation to corroborate the incidents you described?

APPLICANT: No. I didn’t have any.

OFFICER: How did you travel to the United States?

APPLICANT: I… I flew. From… San Salvador to… Houston.

OFFICER: Do you have any family members or friends in the United States?

APPLICANT: No. I don’t know anyone here.

OFFICER: What are your plans if you are granted asylum in the United States?

APPLICANT: I want to… to work. To… to study. To become a lawyer. Like the one I worked for in El Salvador.

OFFICER: You mentioned you only completed the equivalent of seventh grade. How do you plan to pursue a legal career with that level of education?

APPLICANT: I… I will get my GED. And then… go to college. And then… law school. I am very determined.

OFFICER: You indicated that you assisted the lawyer with legal research. Can you describe the legal system in El Salvador?

APPLICANT: (Long pause) It’s… complicated. There are… laws. And courts. And… judges.

OFFICER: What kind of courts are there?

APPLICANT: (Hesitates) Um… family courts. And… criminal courts. And… civil courts.

OFFICER: Can you describe the process of filing a divorce in El Salvador?

APPLICANT: (Visibly uncomfortable) I… I don’t remember the specifics. It’s been a while.

OFFICER: Okay. On your application, you mentioned that you fear being persecuted by gangs if you return to El Salvador. Can you explain why you believe the gangs would target you specifically?

APPLICANT: Because… they target everyone. Especially… young people. They want to recruit them. Or… extort them.

OFFICER: But you said they didn't target you directly before you left. What makes you think they would target you now?

APPLICANT: Because… I left. They will think I… I betrayed them.

OFFICER: Let's go back to the incident where you were pushed down. You said it happened on Calle Aurora. Do you remember the cross street?

APPLICANT: No. I don’t remember. It was… dark. And I was scared.

OFFICER: Was it a residential area? A commercial area?

APPLICANT: It was… mostly houses.

OFFICER: Were there any witnesses to the incident?

APPLICANT: I don’t know. I didn’t see anyone.

OFFICER: You said you left El Salvador about six months after that incident. Why did you wait so long to leave if you felt you were in danger?

APPLICANT: Because… I didn’t have the money. It took me a while to save up.

OFFICER: Where did you get the money?

APPLICANT: I… I borrowed it from my mother.

OFFICER: Is your mother employed?

APPLICANT: Yes. She works as a… a cleaner.

OFFICER: How did she save enough money to lend it to you given her profession?

APPLICANT: (Long pause) She… she had been saving for a long time. For… for emergencies.

OFFICER: Okay. I have no further questions for you at this time. Do you have anything else you would like to add?

APPLICANT: No. I think I have said everything.

OFFICER: Thank you for your time. I will now close this interview. You will receive a written decision regarding your asylum application in the mail. Do you have any questions for me?

APPLICANT: No. Thank you.
