INTERVIEW BEGINS

OFFICER: Good morning. My name is AO-5915, and I am an Asylum Officer with USCIS. This is a credible fear interview. Its purpose is to determine whether you have a credible fear of persecution if you are returned to Guatemala. I will ask you questions about your background and your reasons for leaving Guatemala. You have the right to have your attorney present, and she is here with you today. Ms. Sharma, is that correct?

ATTORNEY: Yes, that's correct. Anya Sharma, representing the applicant.

OFFICER: Thank you. Before we begin, I need to administer an oath. Please raise your right hand and repeat after me: "I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God."

APPLICANT: (Raises right hand) I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God.

OFFICER: Thank you. Please state your full name and date of birth for the record.

APPLICANT: My name is… Esmeralda Flores Morales. My date of birth is… July 12, 1976.

OFFICER: Thank you. And you identify as non-binary?

APPLICANT: Yes, that is correct.

OFFICER: Okay. Can you please tell me about your educational background?

APPLICANT: I finished… secondary school. High school, basically. In my village.

OFFICER: What year did you graduate?

APPLICANT: (Hesitates) Uh… I think it was… 1994. Yes, 1994.

OFFICER: And what did you study in secondary school?

APPLICANT: The usual things. Math, Spanish, some history… basic subjects.

OFFICER: After completing secondary school, did you pursue any further education or training?

APPLICANT: No. I went to work on my family’s farm.

OFFICER: Can you describe your work experience?

APPLICANT: I am a farmer. I grow… mostly corn and beans. Some vegetables too, for the market. It is what my family has done for generations.

OFFICER: For how many years have you been working as a farmer?

APPLICANT: Since… since I left school. So, many years. Almost thirty.

OFFICER: Now, Ms. Flores Morales, I need to understand why you left Guatemala. Please tell me in your own words what happened that caused you to fear returning.

APPLICANT: (Takes a deep breath) It is… complicated. It is because… I am different. Because I am… not a man, not a woman. And because I am… Indigenous.

OFFICER: Can you be more specific? What happened to you personally?

APPLICANT: The… *hombres*… the men in my village… they don’t like… people like me. They say I am… *una vergüenza*… an embarrassment. They… they harass me. They call me names.

OFFICER: Can you give me an example of a specific incident?

APPLICANT: (Looks down) Last year… in… April, I think. It was… the market day. I was selling my beans. And these men… they came to my stall. They… they started shouting at me. Calling me… *maricón*… and other things. They… they knocked over my beans. They… they pushed me.

OFFICER: Do you remember the date in April?

APPLICANT: (Pauses) It was… I think it was the second Saturday. So… April 8th? Maybe 9th. I am not sure exactly.

OFFICER: Were you injured when they pushed you?

APPLICANT: No, not badly. Just… bruises. But it was… humiliating.

OFFICER: Did you report this incident to the police?

APPLICANT: No. What would be the point? The police… they are the same. They would not help me. They would probably laugh.

OFFICER: Have there been other incidents?

APPLICANT: Yes. Many times. They… they throw stones at my house. They… they threaten me. They say they will… fix me.

OFFICER: When was the last time something like that happened?

APPLICANT: Maybe… three months ago? Someone threw a stone through my window.

OFFICER: Three months ago? That would be around September of this year. Did you report that incident?

APPLICANT: No. Like I said, the police…

OFFICER: I understand. Besides these incidents, what else makes you fear returning to Guatemala?

APPLICANT: It is… the feeling. The feeling that… something bad will happen. That they will… hurt me badly. Or… worse.

OFFICER: Have you ever been physically harmed beyond the incident at the market?

APPLICANT: (Hesitates) Not… seriously. Just… pushes and shoves. And the stones.

OFFICER: So, no serious physical injuries?

APPLICANT: No.

OFFICER: Before leaving Guatemala, did you try to relocate to another part of the country where you might feel safer?

APPLICANT: No. I… I don’t have any family anywhere else. And I don’t have the money to move.

OFFICER: Did you consider seeking protection from any organizations, like human rights groups?

APPLICANT: I… I don’t know any organizations like that.

OFFICER: You mentioned that you are also Indigenous. Can you tell me how your Indigenous identity contributes to your fear of persecution?

APPLICANT: (Looks confused) Well… I… it is part of who I am. The men… they also insult me for that. They say I am… *indio*… a dirty Indian.

OFFICER: But is there anything specific that has happened to you because you are Indigenous, separate from the harassment related to your gender identity?

APPLICANT: (Struggles to answer) It is… all mixed together. They hate me for everything.

OFFICER: I understand. Do you have any family members in Guatemala?

APPLICANT: Yes. My mother. She is old.

OFFICER: Is she also at risk?

APPLICANT: I… I don’t know. She is… she is just an old woman. They don’t bother her.

OFFICER: How would your mother survive if you are not there to care for her?

APPLICANT: (Looks worried) That is… that is what I worry about. My cousin… he will help her, I think. But…

OFFICER: Ms. Sharma, do you have any questions for your client at this point?

ATTORNEY: Yes, Officer. Esmeralda, can you tell the officer about the threats you received specifically related to your farming?

APPLICANT: (Confused) My farming?

ATTORNEY: Yes, the men who came to your land and…

APPLICANT: (Interrupting) Oh. Yes. They… they said that… if I didn’t leave… they would… take my land. That they would… burn my crops.

OFFICER: When did this happen?

APPLICANT: This was… last year. Before the market incident. Maybe… February?

OFFICER: Why would they want to take your land?

APPLICANT: They… they want to grow… other things. More profitable things.

OFFICER: Such as?

APPLICANT: (Hesitates) I don’t know exactly. Maybe… palm oil? I heard them talking about it.

OFFICER: Okay. Now, let's talk about your journey to the United States. When did you leave Guatemala?

APPLICANT: I left… in October.

OFFICER: Of this year?

APPLICANT: Yes.

OFFICER: What route did you take?

APPLICANT: I… I took a bus to Mexico. And then… I walked. For a long time.

OFFICER: Did you travel alone?

APPLICANT: No. I was with… some other people.

OFFICER: Who were these people?

APPLICANT: Just… other people who wanted to come to America. I didn’t know them before.

OFFICER: Did you pay anyone to help you travel?

APPLICANT: Yes. I paid… a coyote.

OFFICER: How much did you pay?

APPLICANT: (Hesitates) I… I don’t remember exactly. Maybe… five thousand dollars.

OFFICER: Where did you get that money?

APPLICANT: I… I sold some of my land. A small piece.

OFFICER: You mentioned earlier that you didn't have any money to relocate within Guatemala. How did you have money to pay a coyote $5,000?

APPLICANT: (Looks uncomfortable) It was… different. I had to… I had to do something.

OFFICER: How did you enter the United States?

APPLICANT: I… I crossed the border. In Texas.

OFFICER: When was that?

APPLICANT: In… November.

OFFICER: You said you left Guatemala in October and arrived in November. That's a very fast journey. Can you explain how you traveled so quickly? Walking from Guatemala to Texas usually takes much longer.

APPLICANT: (Stammering) I… I don’t know. I just… I traveled with the coyote. He knew the way.

OFFICER: What are your plans if you are granted asylum in the United States?

APPLICANT: I want to… work. To… to make a life for myself.

OFFICER: You mentioned you are a farmer. Do you plan to continue farming in the United States?

APPLICANT: (Shrugs) Maybe. If I can find land. But… I don’t know. I can do other things too.

OFFICER: What other things can you do?

APPLICANT: I… I can work in construction. I can… clean houses. Anything.

OFFICER: Your file indicates that there's a critical skill shortage in agriculture here in the U.S. Do you think you could utilize your farming expertise to contribute to that sector?

APPLICANT: (Looks confused) I… I don't know about the skill shortage. I just want to work.

OFFICER: Ms. Flores Morales, do you have any documents or other evidence to support your claims of persecution?

APPLICANT: I have… some photos. Of the… the stone that was thrown through my window.

OFFICER: Do you have those with you today?

APPLICANT: Yes. (Hands over a few blurry photos on a phone)

OFFICER: (Examines the photos) Thank you. I will make copies of these. Ms. Sharma, does your client have any other evidence?

ATTORNEY: No, Officer, not at this time.

OFFICER: Ms. Flores Morales, is there anything else you would like to add?

APPLICANT: (Looks pleadingly) I just… I am afraid to go back. I don’t want to die.

OFFICER: Okay. I have a few follow-up questions based on some inconsistencies I’ve noticed. You stated that you sold a piece of land for $5,000 to pay the coyote. However, you also said you couldn't afford to relocate within Guatemala. Why would you sell land, making your situation in Guatemala more precarious, instead of using that money to move somewhere safer within the country?

APPLICANT: (Avoids eye contact) I… I thought… America was my only hope.

OFFICER: Also, you mentioned your journey from Guatemala to Texas took approximately one month. However, based on your description of traveling by bus and then walking, it seems highly unlikely that you could have made that journey in such a short time, especially considering the distance and the challenges involved. Can you explain this discrepancy?

APPLICANT: (Panicked) I… I don’t know. Maybe I am wrong about the dates. It was… a difficult time. Everything is… blurry.

OFFICER: One last question. You mentioned that the men who harassed you called you names and knocked over your beans at the market. While this is certainly unpleasant, does this rise to the level of persecution? Is this why you fear returning, or is there something more that you are not telling me?

APPLICANT: (Starts to cry) It is… everything. All of it together. The names, the threats, the feeling that… that they will kill me.

OFFICER: Thank you. I have no further questions at this time. Ms. Sharma, do you have any closing remarks?

ATTORNEY: Yes, Officer. While my client may have difficulty remembering exact dates and details, her fear is genuine. She has faced significant harassment and discrimination in Guatemala due to her gender identity and Indigenous background. The cumulative effect of these experiences has created a well-founded fear of future persecution. I urge you to consider the totality of the circumstances and find that she has established a credible fear.

OFFICER: Thank you, Ms. Sharma. Ms. Flores Morales, this interview is now concluded. You will be notified of the decision in writing.
