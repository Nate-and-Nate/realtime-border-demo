OFFICER: Officer Davis, do you have any questions?

OFFICER DAVIS: Just a few. Ms. Flores, you mentioned meeting in the forest to practice your religion. Given your professional background, did you ever consider that these meetings might pose a risk to your health and safety, considering the potential for insect bites, exposure to the elements, and other hazards?

OFFICER: Ms. Chen, do you have anything to add?

ATTORNEY: Officer, my client has expressed a genuine fear for her safety and the safety of her sister. The lack of documentation is due to the urgent circumstances of her departure. We believe that her testimony, taken in its entirety, demonstrates a credible fear of persecution.

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I…I just want to be safe. I don’t want to go back.
