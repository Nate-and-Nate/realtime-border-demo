INTERVIEW BEGINS

OFFICER: Good morning. My name is Officer Miller, and I'm an asylum officer with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. This is an interview regarding your application for asylum in the United States. First, I need to ensure you understand the purpose of this interview and that you will answer truthfully. Do you understand that I am an officer with the United States government, and that I will be asking you questions about your claim for asylum?

APPLICANT: Yes, Officer, I understand.

OFFICER: Everything you say here today will be under oath. Do you promise to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

APPLICANT: I do.

OFFICER: Thank you. Please state your full name and date of birth for the record.

APPLICANT: My name is Sofia Elena Morales. My date of birth is October 15, 1980.

OFFICER: Thank you. Your application indicates you are from Guatemala and are seeking asylum based on fear of persecution due to your gender identity. Is that correct?

APPLICANT: Yes, that is correct. I am non-binary, and I face extreme danger in Guatemala because of who I am.

OFFICER: Alright, Sofia. Let's start with your background. Can you tell me about where you grew up in Guatemala?

APPLICANT: I grew up in a small town called San Marcos. It’s in the mountains, very rural. Life was simple, but… also difficult.

OFFICER: Can you describe your family and what life was like growing up?

APPLICANT: I grew up with my parents and three younger siblings, two brothers and a sister. My father was a farmer, and my mother stayed home to care for us. Life was…strict. Very traditional. My parents, they didn’t understand… me. They always expected me to be a 'normal' girl, to marry a man and have children. It wasn’t… possible for me.

OFFICER: You mentioned your parents didn’t understand you. When did you first realize that you identified as non-binary?

APPLICANT: It was always there, inside me. But I didn't have the words for it until later. I always felt different. As I got older, maybe around 15 or 16, I started to understand myself better. I started to meet other people online, people who were like me. It was a slow process of understanding and accepting myself.

OFFICER: Your application states you have no formal education. Is that accurate?

APPLICANT: Yes. I attended school until I was about 12 years old. After that, I had to work to help support my family.

OFFICER: What kind of work did you do?

APPLICANT: Mostly farm work, helping my father. But then, when I was about 18, I joined the military.

OFFICER: You joined the military? Can you tell me more about that? It’s somewhat surprising given the basis of your claim.

APPLICANT: (Hesitates) Yes. It was… complicated. In my town, there weren't many opportunities. The military offered a stable job, a way to support my family. I knew it wouldn't be easy, but I thought I could handle it. Also, joining the military was seen as honorable. I thought maybe I could gain some respect.

OFFICER: What were your duties in the military?

APPLICANT: I started in basic training, of course. Then I was assigned to administrative work. I was good with computers and paperwork. I handled logistics, inventory, things like that.

OFFICER: Did you experience any discrimination or harassment during your time in the military due to your gender identity?

APPLICANT: (Takes a deep breath) Yes. It was constant. I tried to hide who I was, but it was impossible. The other soldiers, they noticed I was different. They called me names, made jokes. Sometimes it was just words, but other times… it was physical. I was pushed around, threatened. One time, a group of soldiers cornered me in the barracks and… (trails off, visibly upset).

OFFICER: You don’t have to go into specific details if you don’t want to, but can you tell me generally what happened?

APPLICANT: They… they assaulted me. It was… humiliating. I reported it to my superior officer, but he just laughed. He said I deserved it for being a "maricón." That's a derogatory term for a gay man. He said I was bringing shame to the military.

OFFICER: Did this type of harassment continue throughout your time in the military?

APPLICANT: Yes. It got worse over time. I lived in constant fear. I tried to avoid attention, but it was impossible. Everyone knew I was different.

OFFICER: How long were you in the military?

APPLICANT: About five years.

OFFICER: Why did you leave?

APPLICANT: I couldn't take it anymore. I was afraid for my life. After the assault, I became depressed and anxious. I couldn't sleep, I couldn't eat. I knew I had to get out. I used some savings and paid a bribe to get a medical discharge. I said I had… back problems. It was easier than explaining the truth.

OFFICER: What did you do after you left the military?

APPLICANT: I went back to my hometown, but things were even worse there. My parents were ashamed of me. They blamed me for bringing disgrace to the family. The community, they also knew about what happened in the military. I was an outcast.

OFFICER: Can you describe any specific incidents that occurred after you returned to your hometown?

APPLICANT: Yes. One night, I was walking home from a friend's house when a group of men attacked me. They were shouting homophobic slurs. They beat me badly. I was left unconscious in the street.

OFFICER: Do you know who these men were?

APPLICANT: I recognized some of them. They were local men, known for being…troublemakers. They were always harassing people.

OFFICER: Did you report this attack to the police?

APPLICANT: No. What was the point? The police in my town are corrupt. They wouldn't have helped me. They probably would have joined in the abuse. They don’t care about people like me.

OFFICER: Did you try to relocate to another part of Guatemala to seek safety?

APPLICANT: Yes, I did. I moved to Guatemala City, hoping to find a more accepting community. But it wasn't much better. There was still a lot of discrimination and violence against LGBTQ+ people. I found a small community of activists, but even they were constantly under threat. I was still living in fear.

OFFICER: Can you provide specific examples of the threats or discrimination you faced in Guatemala City?

APPLICANT: I was often harassed on the street. People would yell slurs at me, threaten me. One time, I was denied service at a restaurant because of how I looked. I also knew several people who were attacked, some even killed, because of their gender identity or sexual orientation. It was a constant reminder of the danger I was in.

OFFICER: Do you have any evidence to support your claims of persecution, such as medical records, police reports, or witness statements?

APPLICANT: I have some photos of the injuries I sustained from the attack in my hometown. I also have some messages from friends in Guatemala City who witnessed the discrimination I faced there. I submitted them with my application. The medical care in my town was… basic. There was no official record of the assault, just the photos I took myself.

OFFICER: You mentioned that you have a family. Are they also at risk?

APPLICANT: Yes. I have a wife, Maria, and two children, Carlos and Isabella. They are also here in the United States with me. Maria has always been supportive of me. She understands who I am. But because of her association with me, she is also at risk. The children, they are too young to understand everything, but they know that we had to leave our home because it was not safe.

OFFICER: How did you and your family travel to the United States?

APPLICANT: We traveled by bus through Mexico. It was a long and dangerous journey. We crossed the border into the United States and then turned ourselves in to immigration officials.

OFFICER: When did you arrive in the United States?

APPLICANT: We arrived on January 15, 2024.

OFFICER: Why did you choose to come to the United States?

APPLICANT: I knew that the United States was a country that valued human rights and protected LGBTQ+ people. I had heard stories about people like me finding safety and acceptance here. I knew it was my only hope for a better life for myself and my family.

OFFICER: What are your plans if you are granted asylum in the United States?

APPLICANT: I want to work and contribute to society. I have skills in administration and logistics from my time in the military. I am also a quick learner and willing to take any job to support my family. I want my children to have the opportunity to get an education and live a life free from fear. I want to be a good neighbor, a good citizen. I want to give back to this country that has given us a chance.

OFFICER: Do you have any family members or friends in the United States who can support you?

APPLICANT: We don't have any close family here, but we have met some wonderful people in the local LGBTQ+ community. They have been very supportive and welcoming.

OFFICER: Do you fear returning to Guatemala?

APPLICANT: (Starts to cry) Yes. I am terrified. If I go back, I will be killed. My family will be in danger. There is no protection for people like me in Guatemala. The police won't help us. The government won't help us. We are on our own.

OFFICER: You mentioned that you paid a bribe to get a medical discharge from the military. Can you provide more details about that?

APPLICANT: (Hesitates) It was… a difficult decision. I knew it was wrong, but I didn't see any other way out. I paid a sum of money to a doctor who worked at the military hospital. He falsified my medical records, saying that I had a chronic back condition. It was enough to get me discharged.

OFFICER: Do you have the name of the doctor or any documentation related to this discharge?

APPLICANT: I don't have the doctor's name. It was all done very discreetly. I don't have any documentation either. I destroyed it all when I left Guatemala. I didn't want to take any chances.

OFFICER: Are you currently working in the United States?

APPLICANT: No, I am not. I am waiting for my work permit to be approved. In the meantime, I am volunteering at a local community center, helping other immigrants with their paperwork.

OFFICER: Do you have any questions for me?

APPLICANT: Yes. How long will it take for a decision to be made on my case?

OFFICER: I cannot give you a specific timeline, but we will process your application as quickly as possible. You will receive a written decision in the mail.

OFFICER: Sofia, I appreciate you sharing your story with me today. I understand this was a difficult interview, and I commend you for your courage. I will carefully review your application and the information you have provided.

APPLICANT: Thank you, Officer.

OFFICER: This concludes our interview. Please keep us informed of any changes to your address or contact information. You will receive a decision on your case in writing.
