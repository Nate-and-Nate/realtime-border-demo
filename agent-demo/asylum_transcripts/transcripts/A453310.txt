INTERVIEW BEGINS

OFFICER: Good morning, Mr. Al-Amin. My name is Officer Davis, and I'm an asylum officer with USCIS. Thank you for coming in today. As you know, you have applied for asylum in the United States. This interview is a crucial part of the process. I need to advise you of a few things before we begin.

First, you are under oath. Do you understand that?

APPLICANT: Yes, I do.

OFFICER: Great. This means that everything you say here today must be truthful. Are you willing to swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

APPLICANT: I am.

OFFICER: Okay. Secondly, I will be asking you questions about your background and experiences in Syria, and why you fear returning. Please answer honestly and to the best of your ability. You have the right to consult with an attorney, but you have chosen to proceed without one today. Is that correct?

APPLICANT: Yes, that is correct.

OFFICER: Alright. I will be taking notes during this interview, and it is being recorded. After the interview, you will have an opportunity to review my notes and add any additional information. Do you understand?

APPLICANT: Yes, I understand completely. Thank you.

OFFICER: Good. Let's begin. Can you please state your full name and date of birth for the record?

APPLICANT: My full name is Omar Al-Amin, and my date of birth is November 12, 1988.

OFFICER: Thank you. And your current address in the United States?

APPLICANT: 14 Oak Street, Apartment 2B, Anytown, USA.

OFFICER: Okay. Mr. Al-Amin, can you tell me about your background? Where were you born and raised?

APPLICANT: I was born and raised in Damascus, Syria. It's… it was a beautiful city, once.

OFFICER: Can you describe your family?

APPLICANT: My family…it’s small. It’s just my wife, Fatima, and myself. We married in 2015. My parents passed away several years ago, before the worst of the war.

OFFICER: I’m sorry to hear that. What is your educational background?

APPLICANT: I have a doctoral degree in law from Damascus University. I specialized in constitutional law.

OFFICER: A doctorate in law. That’s impressive. Can you tell me a little more about your studies? What was your dissertation topic?

APPLICANT: Thank you. My dissertation focused on the erosion of constitutional rights under emergency law, specifically examining the Syrian government’s use of emergency powers to suppress dissent. It was…controversial.

OFFICER: I can imagine. And after you completed your doctorate, what did you do professionally?

APPLICANT: I worked as a legal consultant for several NGOs focusing on human rights and rule of law initiatives. I also taught courses on constitutional law at Damascus University, part-time.

OFFICER: So, you were actively involved in human rights work. That’s relevant to your asylum claim. Now, let’s move on to the reasons why you left Syria. What are you afraid of?

APPLICANT: I am afraid of persecution because of my religious beliefs, my work, and what I wrote in my dissertation. I am a Sunni Muslim, and the Assad regime, dominated by Alawites, has increasingly targeted Sunnis, particularly those perceived as critical of the government.

OFFICER: Can you elaborate on how your Sunni beliefs put you at risk?

APPLICANT: It's…complicated. Officially, the regime claims to be secular, but in practice, there is a clear bias against Sunnis. They are often denied opportunities, face discrimination in employment, and are unfairly targeted in security crackdowns. But more than that, because of my work and my criticism of the government, I was seen as a dissident, an enemy of the state. My religious identity only made me more vulnerable.

OFFICER: You mentioned your work as a legal consultant. How did that put you at risk?

APPLICANT: The NGOs I worked with documented human rights abuses committed by the regime. We provided legal assistance to victims of torture, arbitrary detention, and enforced disappearance. This made us targets. We received threats, and our offices were raided on several occasions.

OFFICER: Can you give me specific examples of threats or incidents you experienced?

APPLICANT: Yes. In March of 2019, our office was raided by the Mukhabarat, the Syrian intelligence agency. They confiscated our computers, files, and arrested several of my colleagues. I was lucky; I wasn’t there at the time. But I knew then that I was being watched.

OFFICER: And what happened to your colleagues?

APPLICANT: They were detained for several weeks. When they were released, they were…different. They wouldn't talk about what happened to them. One of them, a close friend, disappeared again a few months later. I never saw him again.

OFFICER: I'm sorry to hear that. You also mentioned your dissertation. How did that contribute to your fear?

APPLICANT: My dissertation was critical of the regime's use of emergency powers. It argued that these powers were being used to suppress dissent and violate fundamental human rights. After it was published, I received anonymous threats. At first, they were just phone calls, vague warnings. But then, I started receiving emails with pictures of my wife and me, taken without our knowledge. It was clear that I was being watched.

OFFICER: Did you report these threats to the authorities?

APPLICANT: To the police? No. The police are part of the regime. Reporting it to them would have been like reporting it to the people who were threatening me. It would have only made things worse.

OFFICER: Did you try to relocate within Syria to a safer area?

APPLICANT: We considered it. We thought about moving to Latakia, where my wife has some relatives. But Latakia is a stronghold of the Alawite community, and as a Sunni, I would have been even more vulnerable there. Besides, the Mukhabarat has a presence everywhere. There was no place in Syria where I would have been truly safe.

OFFICER: Can you describe the circumstances surrounding your departure from Syria? When did you leave, and how?

APPLICANT: We left in June of 2021. It was…difficult. We sold everything we had to pay for smugglers to get us across the border into Lebanon. From there, we flew to Ecuador. Ecuador had a visa-free policy for Syrians at the time. We stayed in Ecuador for a few months, trying to figure out what to do. Then, we paid another smuggler to help us travel through Central America and Mexico to the United States border.

OFFICER: So, you entered the United States without authorization initially?

APPLICANT: Yes, that’s correct. We crossed the border near Tijuana in December of 2021 and were apprehended by border patrol. We requested asylum at the border.

OFFICER: I see. What evidence do you have to support your claims of persecution?

APPLICANT: I have submitted several documents with my application, including a copy of my dissertation, articles I wrote for human rights publications, and reports from international organizations documenting human rights abuses in Syria. I also have affidavits from former colleagues who can attest to the threats I received and the risks I faced. I also have photos of the raided NGO office.

OFFICER: I’ve reviewed those documents. The dissertation is indeed quite critical of the Syrian government. Have you published any of your work in English?

APPLICANT: Not formally, no. But I have translated excerpts of my dissertation and articles into English. I've also been working on a new paper, focusing on the legal challenges faced by Syrian refugees.

OFFICER: Interesting. What do you plan to do if you are granted asylum here in the United States?

APPLICANT: I want to use my legal expertise to help other refugees and immigrants. I hope to find work with a human rights organization or perhaps teach law at a university. I want to contribute to this country and build a new life here.

OFFICER: Your English is excellent. Have you lived in an English-speaking country before?

APPLICANT: No, I haven't. I learned English in school and through self-study. I knew it would be important for my work, and now, for my future here.

OFFICER: Let’s talk about your wife, Fatima. Is she also afraid to return to Syria?

APPLICANT: Yes, absolutely. She is Sunni as well, and she witnessed the threats and harassment I faced. She fears that if we return, she will be targeted as my wife. Also, she worked as a nurse in a hospital in Damascus. The hospital treated many wounded civilians, including those injured in protests. The regime considered this to be aiding the opposition. She is afraid of being accused of supporting terrorism.

OFFICER: Does she have any specific experiences of harassment or threats?

APPLICANT: She received some threatening phone calls, mostly after my dissertation was published. They were less direct than the ones I received, but they were clearly meant to intimidate her. They would say things like, "Tell your husband to be careful," or "We know where you live." It was terrifying for her.

OFFICER: Has she submitted any documentation to support her claim?

APPLICANT: Yes, she has included an affidavit detailing her experiences and fears. She also included a letter from a former colleague at the hospital who can attest to the hospital's work treating wounded civilians and the risks faced by the staff.

OFFICER: I see. One more question about your journey to the United States. You mentioned paying smugglers. Can you describe how you found them, and what kind of assurances they gave you?

APPLICANT: We found them through contacts in Lebanon. It was…a network. They promised us safe passage, but of course, there were no guarantees. We knew it was risky, but we felt we had no other choice. The situation in Syria was becoming unbearable. We were desperate.

OFFICER: I understand. Mr. Al-Amin, I have a few more routine questions. Have you ever been arrested or convicted of a crime, either in Syria or in any other country?

APPLICANT: No, never.

OFFICER: Have you ever been a member of any political party or organization?

APPLICANT: I was a member of a human rights organization, but not a political party.

OFFICER: Are you currently a member of any organization in the United States?

APPLICANT: No, not yet. I’ve been focusing on my asylum case and trying to adjust to life here.

OFFICER: Okay. Mr. Al-Amin, I think I have a good understanding of your case now. Do you have anything else you would like to add, any information that you think is important for me to consider?

APPLICANT: Yes, actually. I want to emphasize that my fears are not based on hypothetical scenarios. The persecution I fear is real, and it is happening to people like me in Syria every day. I have lost friends and colleagues to the regime's brutality. I am afraid that if I return, I will become another statistic. I just want a chance to live in peace and safety.

OFFICER: Thank you, Mr. Al-Amin. I appreciate your candor. I want to be upfront with you. Based on the information you’ve provided, particularly regarding your dissertation and your work with human rights organizations, as well as the general country conditions in Syria, I am not able to make a decision on your case today. Your case presents complex issues regarding the intersection of religion, political opinion, and the government’s actions. Therefore, I am referring your case to the Immigration Court for further review. You will receive a notice to appear in court with the date and time of your hearing.

APPLICANT: I understand. Thank you for your time.

OFFICER: You’re welcome. Do you have any questions for me about the process moving forward?

APPLICANT: Just one. Will I be allowed to work while my case is pending in court?

OFFICER: You can apply for an Employment Authorization Document (EAD) 150 days after filing your asylum application. You will receive information about that in the mail.

APPLICANT: Thank you.

OFFICER: You’re welcome. That concludes this interview. Please wait here while I prepare some paperwork for you to sign acknowledging that you understand the referral process.
