OFFICER: Good morning. My name is Officer Miller, and this is Asylum Interview A986651. Today is June 27th, 2023. This is an interview for your asylum application. Before we begin, I need to explain the process and administer an oath. I will ask you questions about your reasons for seeking asylum in the United States. It is very important that you understand everything I say and that you answer truthfully. The interpreter will translate everything for you. Do you understand?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Si, entiendo.

OFFICER: Okay. Please raise your right hand. Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Si, juro.

OFFICER: Thank you. Let the record reflect that the applicant has been sworn in. Let’s begin. Please state your full name and date of birth for the record.

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) My name is Elena Maria Rodriguez, and my date of birth is October 15, 1979.

OFFICER: Thank you. And what is your current address in the United States?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) 14 Oak Street, Apartment 2B, Anytown, USA.

OFFICER: Okay. You stated on your application that you are from Nicaragua. Can you tell me where in Nicaragua you lived?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I lived in Managua, the capital.

OFFICER: And how long did you live in Managua?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) All my life. Forty-three years.

OFFICER: Can you describe your educational background?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I went to primary school, Escuela Primaria Ruben Dario, in my neighborhood.

OFFICER: Did you complete primary school?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Si, I finished. Then I did a little bit of… how do you say… secondary school? But I didn’t finish. I had to work.

OFFICER: So, you did not graduate from secondary school?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) No, I did not graduate.

OFFICER: What kind of work did you do?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I helped at the primary school. Mostly assisting the teachers.

OFFICER: Assisting the teachers? Can you be more specific? What were your responsibilities?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Cleaning, making copies, helping the children with their reading… small things.

OFFICER: Were you employed by the school, or were you a volunteer?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I was paid a little. Very little. It was more like a… how do you say… a stipend?

OFFICER: A stipend. Okay. So, you were not a formally employed teacher?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) No, not a teacher. Just helping.

OFFICER: I see. Your application states that you are seeking asylum based on your membership in a particular social group. Can you tell me about that?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes. I am… non-binary.

OFFICER: Can you explain what that means to you?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) It means… I am not a man, not a woman. I am… in between. I don’t feel like a woman, even though I was born one.

OFFICER: Okay. And why do you fear returning to Nicaragua because of this?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Because… people don’t understand. They… they hate us. They call us names. They say we are… unnatural.

OFFICER: Can you give me specific examples of how you have been mistreated in Nicaragua because you are non-binary?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes. Many times. The children at the school… they would laugh at me. They would call me names… “maricon,” “raro.” And the parents… they would look at me with disgust.

OFFICER: And what about adults outside the school?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) On the street… men would yell things. Sometimes they would try to… touch me. Once, a group of men followed me home. They were shouting… terrible things.

OFFICER: When did this happen? Can you give me a date, or at least a month and year?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) It was… maybe two years ago? I don’t remember the exact date. It was… after the protests… maybe 2021?

OFFICER: And what exactly did they do when they followed you?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) They were yelling… “traitor,” “faggot.” They said I was an insult to Nicaragua. They threw rocks at me.

OFFICER: Did they hit you with the rocks?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) No… I ran. I got inside my house.

OFFICER: Did you report this incident to the police?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) No.

OFFICER: Why not?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) The police… they don’t care about people like me. They would probably laugh. Maybe even… hurt me more.

OFFICER: Have you ever been physically harmed because you are non-binary?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) The rocks… they almost hit me. And… sometimes people would push me on the street. Or spit at me.

OFFICER: I understand. Are there any organizations in Nicaragua that support LGBTQ+ individuals?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes, there are some. But… they are not strong. They are afraid. The government… they don’t like them.

OFFICER: Did you ever seek help from any of these organizations?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) No. I was too afraid.

OFFICER: Your application mentions other instances of discrimination. Can you tell me more about the incident at your workplace?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) The director of the school… he started to treat me differently. He would give me… the worst jobs. He would say… I was a bad influence on the children. He started to… cut my hours.

OFFICER: Did he specifically mention your gender identity?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Not directly. But… it was obvious. He would make comments… about my clothes, my hair. He would say… I needed to be more… “normal.”

OFFICER: When did this start happening?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Maybe… three years ago? After I started to… dress more… like myself.

OFFICER: And what do you mean by "dress more like yourself"?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I started wearing… clothes that were not just for women. Pants, shirts… things that made me feel more comfortable.

OFFICER: Did you try to find other work?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes, but it was difficult. No one wanted to hire me. They would see me… and they would say… there were no openings.

OFFICER: Why did you not relocate to another part of Nicaragua where you might feel safer?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I didn't have the money. And… everywhere is the same. The hate is everywhere. The only place I felt safe was in my home.

OFFICER: What supporting documents have you submitted to corroborate your claims of persecution?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I have… a letter from a friend who knows what happened to me. And… some pictures of the protests.

OFFICER: Let’s talk about that letter. Is this friend a member of the LGBTQ+ community?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes. She is a lesbian.

OFFICER: And this friend, what is her profession?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) She works in a market. Selling fruit.

OFFICER: The letter states that she witnessed several instances of discrimination against you. Can you describe one specific incident that she witnessed?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) She saw the men following me… the ones who threw the rocks.

OFFICER: But you said you ran inside before they threw the rocks. How could she have seen that?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) (Hesitates) She… she was walking behind me. She saw them… before they started throwing the rocks. She was scared too, so she hid.

OFFICER: Okay. Your application states that you have two family members who are also at risk in Nicaragua. Who are they?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) My mother and my sister.

OFFICER: Why are they at risk?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Because they are my family. People will think… they are like me. They will be targeted too.

OFFICER: Has your mother or sister ever been threatened or harmed because of your gender identity?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) No… but I am afraid it will happen.

OFFICER: Are your mother and sister aware of your application for asylum?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes.

OFFICER: Do they support your decision to seek asylum?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes. They want me to be safe.

OFFICER: How did you travel here?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I flew from Managua to… Mexico City. Then I took a bus to the border.

OFFICER: And how did you enter the United States?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I crossed the border… near Tijuana.

OFFICER: Did you have a visa when you entered the United States?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes. A tourist visa.

OFFICER: When did you apply for asylum?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Maybe… two weeks after I arrived.

OFFICER: What are your plans if you are granted asylum in the United States?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I want to… find work. I want to… help children. Maybe I can volunteer at a school again.

OFFICER: Given that you did not complete secondary school and only have experience as an assistant, what kind of work do you think you can find in the United States?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I am willing to learn. I am a hard worker. I can clean, I can help… I am good with children.

OFFICER: Do you speak any English?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) No. Not yet. But I want to learn.

OFFICER: How do you plan to learn English?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I will take classes. There are many free classes.
