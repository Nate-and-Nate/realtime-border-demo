INTERVIEW BEGINS

OFFICER: Good morning, Mr. Chen. My name is Officer Miller, and I am an asylum officer with USCIS. This interview is to determine whether you are eligible for asylum in the United States. I want to remind you that you are under oath, and everything you say here today must be the truth. Do you understand?

APPLICANT: Yes, Officer. I understand.

OFFICER: Please raise your right hand. Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

APPLICANT: I do.

OFFICER: Thank you. Before we begin, I want to explain the process. I will ask you questions about your background, your reasons for leaving China, and your fears if you were to return. You may present any evidence you have to support your claim. This interview is confidential, and your responses will be used solely to determine your eligibility for asylum. Do you understand?

APPLICANT: Yes, I understand completely.

OFFICER: Alright, let's start with some background information. Please state your full name and date of birth for the record.

APPLICANT: My full name is Chen, Wei. My date of birth is July 12, 1975.

OFFICER: And where were you born?

APPLICANT: I was born in a small village near Beijing. It’s called… uh… Li Village.

OFFICER: Can you spell that for me?

APPLICANT: L-I, Li Village.

OFFICER: Okay. And what is your highest level of education?

APPLICANT: I completed secondary school. High school, in American terms, I believe.

OFFICER: What year did you graduate?

APPLICANT: Around… 1993, I think. Maybe 1994. It was a long time ago.

OFFICER: And after graduating, what did you do?

APPLICANT: I became a teacher. Mostly teaching history and… and politics. To young students.

OFFICER: Where did you teach?

APPLICANT: At the local village school. It was a small school, just one main building.

OFFICER: What was the name of the school?

APPLICANT: The… the Village Elementary School. Everyone just called it that. It didn’t have a formal name, really.

OFFICER: I see. Now, you're seeking asylum based on your membership in a particular social group. Can you tell me about this group and why you fear persecution because of it?

APPLICANT: Yes. The… the group is… it’s a group of teachers, former teachers, who… who advocate for more freedom of speech in the classroom. We believe students should be allowed to ask questions, to think critically, even if their ideas don't align with the Party.

OFFICER: How did you become involved in this group?

APPLICANT: It started informally. After school, some of us would stay behind and discuss our concerns. We felt stifled, unable to teach honestly. Gradually, it became more organized. We started meeting regularly, sharing ideas, even writing articles for a small, independent online forum.

OFFICER: Can you provide the name of this online forum?

APPLICANT: Uh… I can’t remember the exact name. It was something with “Truth” in it, I think. It was taken down a long time ago. The government shut it down.

OFFICER: When did you start participating in this group?

APPLICANT: Approximately… 2015. Maybe 2016. Around that time.

OFFICER: And when did you first experience problems related to your membership in this group?

APPLICANT: It started subtly. My lessons were scrutinized more closely. I was called in for meetings with the principal, who would lecture me on the importance of adhering to the official curriculum. Then, things escalated.

OFFICER: Can you describe a specific incident of persecution you experienced?

APPLICANT: Yes. In… in late 2017, I believe, I was teaching a lesson on the Cultural Revolution. I tried to present a balanced view, discussing both the achievements and the failures. Afterwards, I was summoned to the local police station. They accused me of spreading "anti-Party propaganda." They kept me there for several hours, interrogating me. They threatened to ruin my career, even harm my family.

OFFICER: Did they physically harm you during this interrogation?

APPLICANT: No… not physically. But the psychological pressure was intense. They made it clear they were watching me.

OFFICER: And what happened after this incident?

APPLICANT: Things got worse. I was demoted. I was no longer allowed to teach history and politics. I was assigned to teach… physical education. And my salary was reduced.

OFFICER: Did you report this treatment to any higher authorities?

APPLICANT: No. Who would I report it to? The police were the ones persecuting me. Reporting them would have been pointless, maybe even dangerous.

OFFICER: Were other members of this group also targeted?

APPLICANT: Yes, some were. I heard rumors that some were fired. Others were transferred to remote schools. It was a campaign to silence us.

OFFICER: Can you provide names of any other members who were targeted?

APPLICANT: I… I don’t want to say their names. I’m afraid for their safety. If I mention their names here, it might cause them more trouble.

OFFICER: I understand your concern, but providing specific details is important for assessing the credibility of your claim.

APPLICANT: Okay… There was… Teacher Li. He was also a history teacher. I heard he was transferred to a school in the mountains. And… Teacher Zhang. I think she was fired. But I don’t know for sure. I lost contact with them.

OFFICER: You mentioned writing articles for an online forum. Do you have copies of these articles?

APPLICANT: No. The forum was taken down, and I didn’t keep copies. It was too dangerous.

OFFICER: Did you try to relocate to another part of China to avoid this persecution?

APPLICANT: I considered it, but I was afraid. The government is everywhere. They have informants everywhere. I didn’t think I could truly escape. Plus, my family… my parents are elderly and live nearby. I felt obligated to stay and care for them.

OFFICER: Are your parents still living in Li Village?

APPLICANT: Yes.

OFFICER: And what is your marital status?

APPLICANT: I am married.

OFFICER: Is your wife with you here in the United States?

APPLICANT: No, she is not. She is still in China.

OFFICER: Why didn’t she come with you?

APPLICANT: She… she didn’t want to leave her parents. She is very close to them, and they are also elderly. Also, she was scared to leave. She didn’t want to risk the journey.

OFFICER: Is she also at risk in China?

APPLICANT: No… not directly. She was not involved in the teacher’s group. But she is my wife. If I am considered an enemy of the state, she could face repercussions.

OFFICER: When did you leave China?

APPLICANT: I left in… October 2022.

OFFICER: What was your route to the United States?

APPLICANT: I flew to Ecuador. Then, I traveled overland through Central America and Mexico.

OFFICER: How long did the journey take?

APPLICANT: It took… about a month. It was very difficult.

OFFICER: And how did you enter the United States?

APPLICANT: I crossed the border near… Tijuana. I surrendered to the border patrol officers and claimed asylum.

OFFICER: Do you have any documents to support your claim? Such as letters, articles, or any evidence of your involvement in this teacher's group?

APPLICANT: I submitted everything I had with my application. I had… a few photos of me with other teachers. And… a copy of my teaching certificate. But I didn’t have much. I had to leave quickly.

OFFICER: Your teaching certificate indicates that you were teaching until 2020. You said you were demoted in 2017 and assigned to physical education. Why does your certificate show you were teaching until 2020?

APPLICANT: Uh… Well, I was still employed by the school. I was still a teacher. But I was teaching… physical education. The certificate doesn’t specify what subject I was teaching.

OFFICER: So, you were teaching physical education until 2020?

APPLICANT: Yes.

OFFICER: But you said you left because of persecution related to your political views expressed as a teacher. If you were teaching physical education, were you still expressing those views?

APPLICANT: Not as openly. But I still talked to my colleagues. I still expressed my opinions in private. And I was still afraid they were watching me.

OFFICER: What are your plans if you are granted asylum in the United States?

APPLICANT: I want to work. I want to contribute to society. I would like to teach again, if possible. I have many years of experience as a teacher. I think I could be a valuable asset to the American education system.

OFFICER: Given your experience teaching history and politics, do you think your background in a system with limited freedom of speech would translate well to the American classroom?

APPLICANT: I am willing to learn. I am willing to adapt. I understand the importance of academic freedom. I would teach my students to think critically, to question everything, just as I wanted to do in China.

OFFICER: Okay. Mr. Chen, I'm going to ask you a few more questions about your journey to the United States. You said you flew to Ecuador. How did you afford the plane ticket?

APPLICANT: I… I saved money. I worked hard my whole life.

OFFICER: And how did you save enough money to travel through Central America and Mexico? That's a significant amount of money.

APPLICANT: I… I borrowed money from friends and family.

OFFICER: Can you provide the names of any friends or family who lent you money?

APPLICANT: I… I don’t want to involve them. They might get in trouble.

OFFICER: Mr. Chen, I need to be honest with you. There are some inconsistencies in your story. You say you were persecuted for expressing your political views as a teacher, but you continued to work as a teacher for three years after you were allegedly demoted. You can't provide specific details about the online forum or the names of other teachers who were targeted. And you're hesitant to provide details about how you financed your journey to the United States. These inconsistencies raise concerns about the credibility of your claim. Do you have anything else you would like to add?

APPLICANT: Officer, I am telling you the truth. I am afraid. I am afraid for myself, and I am afraid for my family. I know I haven’t been able to provide all the details you want, but that is because I am scared. The Chinese government is powerful. They have eyes and ears everywhere. Please believe me. I cannot go back.

OFFICER: Thank you, Mr. Chen. I have no further questions for you at this time. We will review your application and the information you have provided, and you will receive a decision in the mail.

APPLICANT: Thank you, Officer.
