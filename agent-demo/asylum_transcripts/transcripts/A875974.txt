INTERVIEW BEGINS

OFFICER: Good morning. My name is Officer Miller, and this is Asylum Interview A875974. Present is the applicant and their attorney, Sarah Chen. Ms. Chen, can you please confirm you are representing the applicant today?

ATTORNEY: Yes, Officer, I am. Sarah Chen, Bar Number 12345.

OFFICER: Thank you. Applicant, can you please raise your right hand and swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

APPLICANT: I do.

OFFICER: Thank you. Please state your full name and date of birth for the record.

APPLICANT: My name is Mateo Rodriguez, and my date of birth is July 12, 2002.

OFFICER: Thank you, Mateo. Today, we're here to discuss your application for asylum. I want to remind you that you must answer all my questions truthfully and completely. Your attorney is here to advise you, but you are the one providing the testimony. Do you understand?

APPLICANT: Yes, I understand.

OFFICER: Alright, let's start with some background information. Can you tell me about your life in Guatemala? Where did you live, and who did you live with?

APPLICANT: I lived in a small town called San Marcos, in the western highlands of Guatemala. It's a very rural area. I lived with my parents and my younger brother, Diego.

OFFICER: What did your parents do for work?

APPLICANT: My mother was a seamstress, mostly working from home. My father was a farmer; he grew corn and beans on a small plot of land.

OFFICER: And what about you? What did you do before coming to the United States?

APPLICANT: I went to school. I finished secondary school, and then I started working as a tutor, mostly helping younger kids with their studies. I always loved teaching.

OFFICER: You mentioned finishing secondary school. Can you tell me more about your education? What school did you attend, and what subjects did you study?

APPLICANT: I attended the Instituto Nacional de Educación Básica (INEB) in San Marcos. It’s the main public secondary school in the area. I studied a general curriculum – math, science, Spanish literature, history, some English. I also took a vocational class in education, which is what sparked my interest in tutoring.

OFFICER: Do you have any documentation to verify your education?

APPLICANT: Yes, I submitted a copy of my diploma and a transcript with my application. I believe it's Exhibit A.

ATTORNEY: Correct, Officer. Exhibit A includes certified copies of Mateo’s diploma and academic transcript from INEB.

OFFICER: Thank you. Now, let's talk about why you left Guatemala. What were the specific reasons you decided to leave?

APPLICANT: Well, it’s… it’s complicated. But the main reason is because of my religion, and because I'm non-binary. I was being persecuted for both.

OFFICER: Can you elaborate on that? What religion do you practice, and how were you persecuted for it?

APPLICANT: I am a practicing… I follow Mayan spirituality. It’s the traditional religion of the indigenous people in my region. While many people in Guatemala are Catholic or Protestant, my family has always maintained the Mayan traditions. We worship the natural world, the ancestors, and we have specific ceremonies and rituals.

OFFICER: And how were you persecuted for practicing Mayan spirituality?

APPLICANT: In San Marcos, there's a growing evangelical Christian community. They see Mayan spirituality as… as devil worship. They actively try to convert people, and if you don't convert, they harass you. They call you names, they spread rumors, and they try to isolate you from the community.

OFFICER: Can you give me specific examples of this harassment? Dates, locations, who was involved, anything like that.

APPLICANT: Yes. It started subtly, with whispers and stares. Then, one Sunday, after a traditional Mayan ceremony at a sacred site near my village… it was maybe April of 2021… a group of men from the evangelical church confronted us. There were maybe five or six of them. I recognized some of them from the town square. They shouted at us, calling us "heathens" and "devil worshippers." They threw rocks at us. My father was hit in the arm. It wasn't seriously injured, but it was painful and frightening.

OFFICER: Did you report this incident to the police?

APPLICANT: No. The police in San Marcos are… they’re corrupt. They often side with the evangelical community because they’re a powerful group in the town. Reporting it would have made things worse, I think.

OFFICER: You also mentioned being persecuted for being non-binary. Can you tell me more about that?

APPLICANT: Yes. It’s hard to explain… In my community, there’s not a lot of understanding about gender identity. Being anything other than male or female is seen as… wrong. And when the evangelical Christians started targeting us for our religion, they also started targeting me specifically for being different.

OFFICER: How did they target you specifically?

APPLICANT: They would call me names, like "mariposa" which is a derogatory term for a gay person, even though that's not exactly who I am. They would make fun of my clothes, my hair, the way I spoke. They would say that I was an abomination in the eyes of God and that I was leading others astray.

OFFICER: Can you give me a specific instance where this happened?

APPLICANT: Yes. I was walking home from tutoring one evening in July 2022. It was around 6 PM. A group of teenagers from the church stopped me. They surrounded me and started yelling insults. They pushed me to the ground and kicked me. They told me I needed to repent and be "cured" of my "sin." One of them spat on me. I was bruised and shaken.

OFFICER: Did you report this incident to the police?

APPLICANT: No. Again, I didn't think the police would help. And I was afraid of what the teenagers would do if I reported them.

OFFICER: Did you tell your parents about these incidents?

APPLICANT: I told them some of it. I didn't tell them everything because I didn't want to worry them too much. They already had so much to worry about.

OFFICER: Did you try to relocate within Guatemala to escape the persecution?

APPLICANT: Yes, I did. I tried to move to Guatemala City. I have an aunt who lives there. I stayed with her for a few months, but it wasn't safe either. The evangelical Christian influence is spreading throughout the country.

OFFICER: What happened in Guatemala City?

APPLICANT: I was able to find some tutoring work. But even there, I faced discrimination. People would make comments about my appearance, and some parents refused to hire me because they didn't want me teaching their children. I was also afraid of being attacked again. I heard stories of similar things happening to other people like me in the city.

OFFICER: So, why did you decide to come to the United States?

APPLICANT: I felt like I had no other choice. I was afraid for my life in Guatemala. I couldn't practice my religion freely, and I couldn't be myself without fear of violence. I felt like I was trapped.

OFFICER: Do you fear returning to Guatemala now?

APPLICANT: Yes. Absolutely. I know that if I go back, the persecution will continue. It might even get worse. The evangelical community is getting stronger, and they are more emboldened. I don't want to live in fear anymore.

OFFICER: What makes you so sure that the persecution would continue?

APPLICANT: Because it hasn't stopped. My family still lives in San Marcos. I talk to them regularly. They tell me that the situation is getting worse. The church is organizing protests against traditional Mayan practices, and they are openly calling for the expulsion of anyone who doesn't conform to their beliefs. They even threatened my family directly, telling them that they should disown me or face the consequences.

OFFICER: What kind of consequences?

APPLICANT: They didn’t say exactly, but my parents are afraid. They think it could mean losing their land, or worse.

OFFICER: You mentioned having family in the United States. Can you tell me about them?

APPLICANT: Yes, my mother’s sister, my aunt Sofia, is a US citizen. She lives in Los Angeles. She petitioned for my mother and father years ago, but they didn’t want to leave their home. She has been very supportive of me.

OFFICER: Has your aunt Sofia offered you any assistance since you arrived?

APPLICANT: Yes, she has. She helped me find an apartment to rent, and she has been helping me with living expenses while I look for a job. She’s been a real lifeline.

OFFICER: Let’s talk about your journey to the United States. Can you describe your route, the timeline, and how you entered the country?

APPLICANT: I flew from Guatemala City to Mexico City. Then, I traveled by bus to Tijuana. I waited there for a few days, and then I crossed the border into the United States. I presented myself to immigration officials and requested asylum.

OFFICER: Do you have any documentation related to your journey, such as plane tickets or bus tickets?

APPLICANT: I submitted copies of my plane ticket from Guatemala City to Mexico City with my application. The bus tickets I no longer have.

ATTORNEY: Officer, those documents are included in Exhibit B.

OFFICER: Thank you. What are your plans if you are granted asylum in the United States?

APPLICANT: I want to build a new life here. I want to continue my education. I would love to get a degree in education and become a teacher. I want to use my skills to help others, especially children. I also want to be able to live openly and freely, without fear of persecution.

OFFICER: You mentioned wanting to continue your education. Have you looked into any schools or programs in the United States?

APPLICANT: Yes, I have. I've been researching community colleges in the Los Angeles area. I've also been taking English classes to improve my language skills.

OFFICER: Your English is quite good. How did you learn English?

APPLICANT: I studied it in secondary school, and I also practiced with tourists who visited my town. I always enjoyed learning languages.

OFFICER: Mateo, I'm going to ask you a few more questions to clarify some points. You mentioned that your family still practices Mayan spirituality in Guatemala. Has their practice become more discreet or have they altered it in any way since the persecution began?

APPLICANT: They have tried to be more careful. They don’t hold ceremonies as openly as they used to. They try to keep a low profile and avoid drawing attention to themselves. But it's hard, because our traditions are so deeply ingrained in our lives.

OFFICER: And has the persecution affected your brother, Diego, as well?

APPLICANT: Yes, it has. He's younger than me, so he's more vulnerable. He's been bullied at school because of our family's religion and because of my identity. My parents are very worried about him.

OFFICER: Officer Miller pauses, reviewing notes.

OFFICER: Mateo, I appreciate you sharing your story with me today. It sounds like you’ve been through a lot. Before we conclude, is there anything else you would like to add or any other information you think is important for me to know?

APPLICANT: Yes. I just want to say that I’m not exaggerating anything. Everything I’ve told you is the truth. I’m genuinely afraid to go back to Guatemala. I just want a chance to live a peaceful life here, where I can be myself and practice my religion without fear.

ATTORNEY: Officer, I would like to add that we have submitted extensive documentation to support Mateo’s claims, including country conditions reports about the persecution of indigenous religions and LGBTQ+ individuals in Guatemala. We believe that Mateo has demonstrated a well-founded fear of persecution based on both religion and membership in a particular social group.

OFFICER: Thank you, Ms. Chen. I have reviewed the submitted documentation. Mateo, I want to inform you that I will be making a recommendation on your case. You will receive a written decision in the mail. Do you have any questions for me at this time?

APPLICANT: No, I don't think so. Thank you for listening to me.

OFFICER: You're welcome. This interview is concluded.
