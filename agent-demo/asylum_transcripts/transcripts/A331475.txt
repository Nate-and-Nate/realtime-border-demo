INTERVIEW BEGINS

OFFICER: Good morning. My name is Officer Davis, and my identification number is 7080. I am an asylum officer with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Today, I will be conducting a credible fear interview with you to determine if you have a credible fear of persecution if you are returned to Nicaragua. This interview is being recorded. Do you understand?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes, I understand.

OFFICER: Before we begin, I need to swear you in. Please raise your right hand. Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) My name is Alex Rodriguez, R-O-D-R-I-G-U-E-Z.

OFFICER: And your date of birth?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) April 10, 1995.

OFFICER: Thank you. Now, Mr. Rodriguez, can you tell me why you left Nicaragua and why you are afraid to return?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I left because I am… I am afraid of the government. Because of my political… my political views and…and because I am non-binary.

OFFICER: Okay. Let’s start with your political views. Can you describe your political beliefs and how they put you at risk in Nicaragua?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I… I believe in democracy. I believe the current government is corrupt and… and oppresses the people. I participated in protests, peaceful protests, against the government… back in 2018.

OFFICER: Can you tell me more about these protests? Where were they, and what was your role?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) They were in Managua, mostly around the university area. I was… I was helping injured people. I am… I was training as a nurse. I provided first aid to protesters who were hurt by the police and… and the paramilitaries.

OFFICER: When you say "paramilitaries," who are you referring to?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) They are… groups that support the government. They are armed and… they work with the police to suppress protests. They wear civilian clothes, but everyone knows who they are.

OFFICER: Do you have any evidence that you were, in fact, providing medical assistance?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I… I don’t have… like, a certificate or anything. But I have… I had a bag with medical supplies. Some of my friends, they know I was helping. And… I think… I think some news reports showed people helping the injured. Maybe I am in those… in those videos.

OFFICER: Okay. Did the police or paramilitaries ever target you directly during these protests?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes. One time, in May 2018, I was helping a young man who had been shot in the leg. The police… they started shooting at us. I was hit with a rubber bullet… here, on my arm. (Applicant points to their left arm). I still have a scar.

OFFICER: (Making a note) Can you show me the scar?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) (Rolls up sleeve to show a faint scar on their left forearm.) It is… it is small now, but it was big then.

OFFICER: I see. Thank you. Did you report this incident to the police?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) No! Are you crazy? The police shot me! Why would I report it to them? They are… they are the ones who hurt me.

OFFICER: I understand. Did anything else happen to you related to your participation in the protests?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) After the protests, the government started arresting people. They… they came to my house looking for me. In… in June 2019.

OFFICER: How do you know they were looking for you?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) My neighbor, she saw them. She is… she is a good friend. She told me they asked for me by name. They said I was a “troublemaker” and that I was “against the government.”

OFFICER: Did they enter your house?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes. They broke down the door. They searched everything. They took my computer and some of my… my medical books.

OFFICER: After that incident, did you try to move to another part of Nicaragua?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes. I went to live with my aunt in Matagalpa. But… but it was not safe. The government… their supporters are everywhere.

OFFICER: Why wasn't it safe? Did something happen in Matagalpa?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes. In December 2021, I was… I was walking home from the clinic where I was working. Two men… they stopped me. They called me names… “traitor,” “communist,” “faggot.” They said I should leave Matagalpa or… or something bad would happen to me.

OFFICER: Did you recognize these men?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) No, but they… they were wearing t-shirts with the government party’s logo.

OFFICER: You mentioned you were working at a clinic. Can you tell me more about your professional background? What kind of training do you have?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I finished secondary school and then I studied nursing for two years. I didn't finish the full program, but I have a lot of experience. I worked as a nurse’s assistant in a hospital in Managua and then at the clinic in Matagalpa.

OFFICER: So you didn't get a nursing degree?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) No, not a full degree. Just… some training. I am good at… at taking care of people. I know how to give injections, check blood pressure, dress wounds…

OFFICER: Okay. Let’s go back to the incident in Matagalpa. What happened after these men threatened you?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I was very scared. I told my aunt, and she was scared too. We decided… I decided I had to leave the country.

OFFICER: Why couldn’t you stay with your aunt?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Because they knew where she lived! They would come back. I didn’t want to put her in danger. She is old and… and she has health problems.

OFFICER: You also mentioned that you are non-binary. How does that put you at risk in Nicaragua?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) It is… it is not safe to be LGBTQ+ in Nicaragua. The government… they are very conservative. They don’t… they don’t like people who are different. There is a lot of discrimination and… and violence.

OFFICER: Can you give me specific examples of how you have been discriminated against or experienced violence because of your gender identity?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) People… they stare at me. They call me names. Men… they harass me on the street. One time, I was… I was attacked in a bathroom. A man… he pushed me and… he said I didn’t belong there. He said I was disgusting.

OFFICER: When did this happen?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) This was in… in Managua, in 2020. At a… at a bus station.

OFFICER: Did you report this to the police?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) No. What would be the point? The police… they don’t care. They would probably laugh at me. Or… or arrest me.

OFFICER: Do you have any documentation to support your claim that you are non-binary, such as a medical or psychological evaluation?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) No, I don't have anything like that. In Nicaragua, it is… it is not easy to get those things. People don't understand.

OFFICER: I understand. Let’s talk about your journey to the United States. When did you leave Nicaragua?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I left in… in January 2024.

OFFICER: Can you describe your route?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I went to… to Honduras, then Guatemala, then Mexico. It was… it was very difficult. I traveled with a group of people. We walked a lot. We took buses sometimes.

OFFICER: How did you enter the United States?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I crossed the border in… in Texas. I turned myself in to the border patrol.

OFFICER: Do you have any family members in Nicaragua who are still at risk?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes. My mother and my sister. They are… they are worried about me. But they are also worried about themselves. Because… because they know I protested against the government.

OFFICER: Do you believe the government would target them because of your actions?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes. I am sure of it. They… they punish families.

OFFICER: Do you have any evidence to support this claim?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I… I don’t have papers. But it is… it is common knowledge. Everyone knows the government does this.

OFFICER: If you are granted asylum in the United States, what are your plans?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I want to work. I want to use my skills to help people. I want to… I want to become a certified nurse. I want to live in peace.

OFFICER: You mentioned you didn’t complete your nursing degree. Are you planning to go back to school here?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes. I hope so. I know I need to… to study more. I am willing to work hard.

OFFICER: What is your English level?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) (In broken English) Little bit. I… I learn more.

OFFICER: (To the interpreter) Can you ask him to describe his English language learning experience?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I started learning English in school, but I didn't learn much. I have been trying to learn more since I left Nicaragua. I use an app on my phone. I watch TV shows with subtitles.

OFFICER: Do you have any documents with you today that you want to show me?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I have… I have some photos of me at the protests. And a… a copy of my secondary school diploma.

OFFICER: Please show them to me. (Reviews the photos and diploma). These photos appear to show you at a protest. It is difficult to verify the location or date. The diploma appears to be legitimate. Thank you.

OFFICER: Do you have anything else you would like to add?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I am… I am very afraid to go back to Nicaragua. I believe the government will arrest me. They will… they will torture me. I just want to be safe. I want to live a normal life.

OFFICER: Okay. I have no further questions for you at this time. Thank you for your cooperation. I will now review the information you have provided and make a determination regarding your credible fear. You will be notified of the decision in writing. Do you understand?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes, I understand. Thank you.

OFFICER: One moment, I have to ask you some standard questions. Do you fear being subjected to torture in Nicaragua?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes, I do.

OFFICER: Do you wish to be considered for withholding of removal?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes, I do.

OFFICER: Thank you.
