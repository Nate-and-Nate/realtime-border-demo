INTERVIEW BEGINS

OFFICER: Good morning. My name is Officer Miller, and this is a credible fear interview. This interview is to determine whether you have a credible fear of persecution if you are returned to Guatemala. Do you understand?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Si, I understand.

OFFICER: I need to swear you in. Please raise your right hand. Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Si, I swear.

OFFICER: Thank you. Please state your full name and date of birth for the record.

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) My name is… (pauses, looking down) …Esmeralda… Esmeralda Flores. My birthday is… (pauses again) …May 12, 1965.

OFFICER: And is that 1965?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Si, mil novecientos sesenta y cinco.

OFFICER: Thank you. You indicated you are seeking asylum based on a fear of persecution due to your nationality. Is that correct?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Si, correct.

OFFICER: Okay. Before we get into the details of your fear, I need to ask you some background questions. Please tell me, what is the highest level of education you completed in Guatemala?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Only… primaria. Just primary school.

OFFICER: Did you finish primary school?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Si, I finished.

OFFICER: And what did you do for work in Guatemala?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I am… (gestures with hands) …agricultura. I work the land. Farming.

OFFICER: Can you describe what kind of farming you did? What did you grow?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Mostly… maiz. Corn. And frijoles. Beans. Some vegetables, too. For my family and to sell at the market.

OFFICER: Where did you live in Guatemala?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I lived in a small village… near… (struggles to remember) …San Marcos. A little village called… Aldea Nueva Esperanza. New Hope Village.

OFFICER: Aldea Nueva Esperanza, San Marcos. Okay. Now, can you tell me why you left Guatemala? Why are you afraid to return?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) (Voice trembling) Because… because of who I am. Because I am… different.

OFFICER: Different how? Can you explain further?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) (Looks down, wringing hands) They… they don’t like people like me. They say I am… an embarrassment. They call me names. They threaten me.

OFFICER: Who threatens you? Can you give me specific examples?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) It started… maybe two years ago. Young men… from the village. They would shout things… “maricon,” “travesti.” Things like that. Then… then it got worse.

OFFICER: Worse how?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) (Tears welling up) One night… they came to my house. Four of them. They broke down the door. They… they beat me. They said I was… disgusting. They said I needed to leave.

OFFICER: When did this happen? Can you give me a date or an approximate date?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) (Thinking hard) …Maybe… June of… 2023? I think. It was… after the corn harvest.

OFFICER: Where were you beaten? Inside your house?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Si, inside. They dragged me from my bed.

OFFICER: Did you report this to the police?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) No.

OFFICER: Why not?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) (Shakes head) The police… they are the same. They don’t care. They would probably laugh. Or… or join them.

OFFICER: Did you seek medical attention after the beating?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) No. I was… too afraid. My neighbor… she helped me. She cleaned my wounds.

OFFICER: Do you have her name?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Maria. Maria Elena.

OFFICER: After this incident in June 2023, what happened next?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Things… got worse. They would follow me. They would throw rocks at my house. They would threaten to kill me.

OFFICER: Did you try to move to another part of Guatemala? To a larger city where you might be safer?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) (Looks down) I… I thought about it. But… I have no money. And… where would I go? I don’t know anyone in the city.

OFFICER: You said you are seeking asylum based on your nationality. Can you explain how your nationality connects to the persecution you experienced?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) (Confused) I… I don’t understand.

OFFICER: You marked "nationality" as the basis for your fear. Nationality usually refers to your citizenship or ethnicity. How does that relate to why you left Guatemala?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) (Hesitates) I… I don't understand the words exactly. I am afraid because… because of who I am. Because I am… not like the others.

OFFICER: So, you're saying it's not about your Guatemalan citizenship itself, but about your… identity? About how you express yourself?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Si, yes. That is it.

OFFICER: Okay. Let’s clarify this. It sounds like you are being persecuted because of your gender identity or sexual orientation. Is that correct?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) (Nods slowly) Si.

OFFICER: You mentioned that you are… different. Can you tell me more about how you identify?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) (Looks uncomfortable) I… I am not a man. But… I am not a woman either. I am… in between.

OFFICER: You identify as non-binary?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) (Confused) I… I don’t know that word. But… yes. I think so.

OFFICER: Okay. Thank you for clarifying. This is important for your case. Now, going back to the threats, did these men ever mention why they were targeting you specifically?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) They said… I was an abomination. That I was… going against God. That I was bringing shame to the village.

OFFICER: Did you ever try to talk to any community leaders or religious figures about this?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) No. They… they are the same. They believe the same things.

OFFICER: Do you have any evidence to support your claims? Any photos of the injuries, police reports, or witness statements?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) No. I… I was too afraid to take pictures. And… like I said, the police would not help.

OFFICER: You mentioned a neighbor, Maria Elena, who helped you. Do you have any way to contact her?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) No. I left… quickly. I didn’t have time to say goodbye.

OFFICER: Let’s talk about your journey to the United States. When did you leave Guatemala?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) …November of 2024.

OFFICER: And what route did you take?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) By bus… to Mexico. Then… walking. With a coyote.

OFFICER: You paid a smuggler?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Si.

OFFICER: How much did you pay?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) …Five thousand dollars.

OFFICER: Where did you get that money?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I… I sold my land. My small plot of land. It was all I had.

OFFICER: And how did you enter the United States?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) …Across the border. Near… Tijuana.

OFFICER: And you were apprehended by immigration officials?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Si.

OFFICER: You indicated on your form that you have a family member in the United States who is a citizen. Can you tell me about that?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Si, my sister. Elena. She is a citizen. She lives in… Los Angeles.

OFFICER: How long has she been a citizen?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) …More than ten years.

OFFICER: Does she know you are here?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Si. I called her.

OFFICER: Has she offered to help you?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Si. She said I can stay with her.

OFFICER: What are your plans if you are granted asylum here in the United States?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I want to… work. I want to… farm. Maybe… find a place to grow vegetables. I know how to work hard.

OFFICER: Do you speak any English?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) (Hesitates) …Poco. A little. "Hello," "Thank you."

OFFICER: Do you plan to learn English?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Si. I will try.

OFFICER: You also indicated that you have one dependent family member on your application. Who is that?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) My… my nephew. He is… like a son to me. His parents… died.

OFFICER: How old is your nephew?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) He is… seventeen.

OFFICER: Is he still in Guatemala?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Si. I hope to bring him here… if I can.

OFFICER: Is he also at risk in Guatemala?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) (Looks worried) Yes. Because… because he is with me. They will think… he is like me too.

OFFICER: Has he been threatened or harmed?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Not yet… but I fear it will happen. That’s why I left, to try to protect him.

OFFICER: Is there anything else you would like to add? Anything else you think I should know?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) (Tears streaming down face) I just… I just want to be safe. I want to live in peace. I don’t want to be afraid anymore.

OFFICER: Okay. I have some follow-up questions regarding the sale of your land. You stated you sold your land for $5,000 USD. Can you describe the process of selling your land? Who did you sell it to? Do you have any documentation of the sale? Given your education level, how did you ensure you received a fair price?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I… I sold it to a man in the village. He… he offered me the money. I didn’t have any papers. I just… I needed to leave. He knew I was desperate. He… he probably didn’t give me a fair price, but I didn’t know what else to do. There are no papers. It was just… an agreement.

OFFICER: And you are sure that you have no documentation regarding this sale?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) (Shakes head) No. Nothing.

OFFICER: Okay. Thank you. I need to inform you that I will be making a determination on whether you have demonstrated a credible fear of persecution. I will notify you of my decision in writing. Do you understand?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Si, I understand.

OFFICER: This concludes the interview.
