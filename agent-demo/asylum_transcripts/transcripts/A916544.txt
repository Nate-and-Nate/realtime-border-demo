INTERVIEW BEGINS

OFFICER: Good morning, Ms. Rodriguez. My name is Officer Miller, and this is a formal asylum interview. I need to verify some information and understand why you fear returning to Cuba. Please raise your right hand and repeat after me: “I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God.”

APPLICANT: (Raises hand) I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God.

OFFICER: Thank you. And good morning, Counsel. Please state your name for the record.

ATTORNEY: Good morning, Officer Miller. My name is Sarah Chen, and I represent Ms. Rodriguez.

OFFICER: Thank you. Ms. Rodriguez, can you please state your full name and date of birth for the record?

APPLICANT: My name is Elena Maria Rodriguez Sanchez, and my date of birth is July 12, 1971.

OFFICER: Thank you. Ms. Rodriguez, you are currently in removal proceedings, and you are seeking asylum as a defense against deportation. Is that correct?

APPLICANT: Yes, that is correct.

OFFICER: Let's start with your background. Can you tell me about your life in Cuba before you left? Where did you live, and what was your daily life like?

APPLICANT: I lived in Havana all my life. My daily life… it was difficult. I lived with my husband, Miguel. We… we struggled. I worked… different jobs.

OFFICER: What kind of jobs did you have?

APPLICANT: Mostly… manual labor. Cleaning, sometimes helping at the market. Things like that.

OFFICER: I see. Your application indicates you work in a STEM field. Can you elaborate on that?

APPLICANT: (Hesitates) STEM… Yes, that’s right. I… I worked with computers.

OFFICER: Can you be more specific about the kind of work you did with computers? What kind of company did you work for? What were your responsibilities?

APPLICANT: (Looks at her attorney briefly) It wasn’t a company, exactly. It was… more informal. I helped people fix their computers. You know, small things.

OFFICER: So, you were self-employed as a computer repair person?

APPLICANT: Yes, something like that.

OFFICER: How did you learn these computer skills?

APPLICANT: (Pause) I… I learned on my own. I read books, you know? And I practiced.

OFFICER: You indicated on your application that you have no formal education. Is that correct?

APPLICANT: Yes, that's correct.

OFFICER: So you taught yourself complex computer repair skills without any formal training or schooling?

APPLICANT: Yes. It was… difficult. But I am a fast learner.

OFFICER: Okay. Let's move on. You are claiming asylum based on fear of persecution due to your political opinion. Can you tell me what your political opinion is?

APPLICANT: I… I don't support the government. I believe in freedom.

OFFICER: Can you be more specific? What actions did you take, or what statements did you make, that expressed this political opinion?

APPLICANT: I… I talked to people. I told them that things were not right. That the government was corrupt.

OFFICER: Can you give me an example of a specific conversation you had, and who you spoke with?

APPLICANT: (Pause) I talked to my neighbors. We would talk about the food shortages, the lack of medicine. We all felt the same way.

OFFICER: Did you participate in any protests or demonstrations?

APPLICANT: No, I was too afraid.

OFFICER: You stated in your application that you were persecuted because of your political opinion. Can you describe a specific incident of persecution you experienced?

APPLICANT: (Looks down) One time… the police came to my house.

OFFICER: When was this?

APPLICANT: About… six months before I left Cuba.

OFFICER: Can you give me a specific date, or at least the month and year?

APPLICANT: I… I don't remember the exact date. It was around… June of 2022.

OFFICER: What happened when the police came to your house?

APPLICANT: They… they searched the house. They said they were looking for… for illegal materials.

OFFICER: Did they find anything?

APPLICANT: No.

OFFICER: What did they say to you?

APPLICANT: They said I was a troublemaker. That I should be careful what I say.

OFFICER: Did they arrest you?

APPLICANT: No.

OFFICER: Did they physically harm you?

APPLICANT: No.

OFFICER: You also mentioned in your application that your husband was harassed. Can you describe that incident?

APPLICANT: Yes. He… he worked at the factory. They told him that he was… under suspicion because of me. They said he could lose his job.

OFFICER: Do you know specifically what they said to him, or who said it?

APPLICANT: I don't know the exact words. He didn't want to talk about it too much. He was afraid. His supervisor spoke with him.

OFFICER: Did your husband lose his job?

APPLICANT: No, he didn't.

OFFICER: After these incidents, did you report them to the police or any other authorities?

APPLICANT: No.

OFFICER: Why not?

APPLICANT: (Pause) I didn't trust them. They are part of the government.

OFFICER: Did you consider moving to another part of Cuba to avoid these problems?

APPLICANT: No. We didn't have the money. And I thought they would find us anyway.

OFFICER: What made you decide to leave Cuba?

APPLICANT: I was afraid. I thought they would arrest me. Or do something worse to my husband.

OFFICER: Can you explain why you believe you are specifically targeted, rather than just experiencing the general difficulties faced by many Cubans?

APPLICANT: Because… because they came to my house. And they threatened my husband. It was because of my… my opinions.

OFFICER: Do you have any evidence to support your claims? Any documents, photos, or other materials?

APPLICANT: I have… (Looks at her attorney) I have some letters from my family.

ATTORNEY: We submitted those letters with the application, Officer.

OFFICER: I see. Ms. Rodriguez, these letters describe difficult living conditions in Cuba, but they don't specifically mention any persecution you faced.

APPLICANT: They… they don't want to say too much. They are afraid too.

OFFICER: I understand. Is your husband with you here in the United States?

APPLICANT: No. He is still in Cuba.

OFFICER: Why didn't he come with you?

APPLICANT: He… he couldn't get a visa.

OFFICER: How did you travel to the United States?

APPLICANT: I flew to Mexico. Then I crossed the border.

OFFICER: When did you enter the United States?

APPLICANT: August 15, 2022.

OFFICER: How did you cross the border?

APPLICANT: (Hesitates) I… I walked.

OFFICER: Did you have any assistance crossing the border?

APPLICANT: (Looks down) Yes. Someone helped me.

OFFICER: Who helped you?

APPLICANT: I don't know his name.

OFFICER: Did you pay him?

APPLICANT: Yes.

OFFICER: How much did you pay him?

APPLICANT: I paid him… $500.

OFFICER: Ms. Rodriguez, based on your statement of your limited financial situation in Cuba, how did you obtain $500 to pay someone to help you cross the border?

APPLICANT: (Long pause) My family… they helped me. They sent me money.

OFFICER: You stated earlier that your family is afraid to speak freely in letters and experiences food shortages and lack of medicine. How did your family manage to send you $500?

APPLICANT: (Silence)

ATTORNEY: Officer, I would advise my client to invoke her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination regarding how she obtained the $500.

OFFICER: Noted, Counsel. Ms. Rodriguez, if you are granted asylum, what are your plans for the future?

APPLICANT: I want to work. I want to… to have a better life. I want to bring my husband here.

OFFICER: Given your background in computer repair, how do you plan to utilize those skills in the United States?

APPLICANT: I will… I will find a job. Fixing computers.

OFFICER: You stated you have no formal education. Are you aware that most computer repair positions in the United States require certifications or formal training?

APPLICANT: I can… I can learn. I am a fast learner.

OFFICER: Ms. Rodriguez, do you have any questions for me?

APPLICANT: Will I be safe here?

OFFICER: I cannot guarantee your safety. My role is to determine whether you meet the legal requirements for asylum.

OFFICER: (To the Attorney) Counsel, do you have any questions for your client?

ATTORNEY: No, Officer, thank you.

OFFICER: Okay, Ms. Rodriguez, thank you for your time. We will review your case and notify you of our decision.
