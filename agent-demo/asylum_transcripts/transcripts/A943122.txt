INTERVIEW BEGINS

OFFICER: Good morning, Ms. Elena Rodriguez. My name is Officer Miller, and I am an asylum officer with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Thank you for coming in today for your credible fear interview. Before we begin, I need to explain the purpose of this interview and administer an oath.

APPLICANT: Good morning, Officer Miller. Thank you for seeing me.

OFFICER: The purpose of this interview is to determine whether you have a credible fear of persecution if you were to be returned to El Salvador. A credible fear means there is a significant possibility, taking into account the credibility of your statements and other facts known to the officer, that you could establish eligibility for asylum. Do you understand?

APPLICANT: Yes, I understand.

OFFICER: Before we proceed, I need you to swear or affirm that the testimony you give today will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

APPLICANT: I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God.

APPLICANT: My full name is Elena Maria Rodriguez. My date of birth is July 12, 1961.

OFFICER: Thank you. Can you please spell your last name for the record?

APPLICANT: R-O-D-R-I-G-U-E-Z.

OFFICER: Thank you. Ms. Rodriguez, you stated that you are seeking asylum based on fear of persecution due to gender-based violence in El Salvador. Is that correct?

APPLICANT: Yes, that is correct.

OFFICER: Okay. Let's start with some background information. Where in El Salvador were you born and where did you live before leaving?

APPLICANT: I was born in San Salvador, and I lived there my whole life, in the Mejicanos neighborhood.

OFFICER: And what is your highest level of education?

APPLICANT: I have a Master's degree in Civil Engineering.

OFFICER: A Master's in Civil Engineering. That's impressive. From which university did you obtain this degree?

APPLICANT: Universidad Centroamericana "José Simeón Cañas," UCA.

OFFICER: And what year did you graduate?

APPLICANT: 1985.

OFFICER: Okay. So you've had this degree for quite a while. What type of work did you do in El Salvador?

APPLICANT: I worked in construction. Mostly project management. I oversaw the construction of several buildings, roads… various projects.

OFFICER: Can you provide some examples of specific projects you managed?

APPLICANT: I worked on a housing development project in Santa Tecla… it was a large one, many houses. And I also worked on a section of the highway connecting San Salvador to the airport.

OFFICER: How long did you work on the highway project?

APPLICANT: About two years, I think. It was… a while ago.

OFFICER: Ms. Rodriguez, your application states that you are afraid to return to El Salvador because of gender-based violence. Can you tell me more about what happened to you?

APPLICANT: Yes. It started… well, it was always there, the feeling of being less, of not being respected because I am a woman. But it became worse after… after I refused the advances of a man.

OFFICER: Can you tell me more about this man and his advances?

APPLICANT: He was… well, he is a powerful man. Connected to… well, connected. He offered me… well, he suggested that if I… if I was nice to him, my business would do very well. He could ensure contracts, things like that.

OFFICER: What business are you referring to? I thought you worked for construction companies.

APPLICANT: Yes, I did. But… I also had my own small business on the side. I bought and sold construction materials. It was how I made extra money.

OFFICER: So, this man offered you business opportunities if you were "nice" to him. What did you do?

APPLICANT: I refused. I told him I was not interested in that kind of arrangement.

OFFICER: And what happened after you refused?

APPLICANT: Things started to go wrong. Suddenly, my contracts were cancelled. Permits were delayed. I was… threatened.

OFFICER: Can you describe the threats?

APPLICANT: Men would come to my house. They would shout things… insults. They said I should reconsider my decision. They said… they said things would get worse if I didn't cooperate.

OFFICER: When did these threats start? Can you give me a specific date or timeframe?

APPLICANT: It was… about a year ago. Maybe… March of 2023.

OFFICER: And how frequently did these threats occur?

APPLICANT: At first, it was once a week. Then, it became more frequent… two or three times a week. Sometimes, they would come at night, banging on my door.

OFFICER: Did you report these incidents to the police?

APPLICANT: No.

OFFICER: Why not?

APPLICANT: Because… they wouldn't do anything. This man… he has connections. The police are afraid of him.

OFFICER: Do you know his name?

APPLICANT: I… I don't want to say his name. I'm still afraid.

OFFICER: I understand your fear, Ms. Rodriguez, but providing his name would help us assess the credibility of your claim.

APPLICANT: (Hesitates) His name is… Ricardo Vargas.

OFFICER: And you believe Ricardo Vargas is connected to these threats and the cancellation of your contracts?

APPLICANT: Yes. I know he is.

OFFICER: Did you ever see Ricardo Vargas himself making these threats?

APPLICANT: No, not personally. But… everyone knows. It was understood.

OFFICER: Ms. Rodriguez, you stated that you have a Master's degree in Civil Engineering and worked on significant construction projects. Given your education and experience, why were you relying on a small business selling construction materials for extra income? It seems unusual.

APPLICANT: (Hesitates) Well… the construction industry in El Salvador is… difficult. There is a lot of corruption. It’s hard to find work, even with my qualifications. The small business helped to… supplement my income.

OFFICER: So, you were struggling to find work as a civil engineer even with a Master's degree?

APPLICANT: Yes.

OFFICER: Did you try to find work in another part of El Salvador, away from Ricardo Vargas and his influence?

APPLICANT: No. I… I have my family in San Salvador. I didn't want to leave them.

OFFICER: You stated on your application that you have no dependent family members.

APPLICANT: No, I don’t have dependents. But my sister and her children live there. I didn’t want to leave them.

OFFICER: So, you feared for your safety but didn't consider relocating within El Salvador to protect yourself while remaining close to your family?

APPLICANT: (Silence)

OFFICER: Ms. Rodriguez, you said the threats started in March of 2023. When did you leave El Salvador?

APPLICANT: I left… in January of this year.

OFFICER: January of 2024. So, you endured these threats for almost a year before leaving?

APPLICANT: Yes.

OFFICER: Why did you wait so long?

APPLICANT: I was hoping… I was hoping things would get better. I thought maybe he would forget about me. But… they didn't.

OFFICER: Can you describe your journey to the United States?

APPLICANT: I… I flew to Guatemala. Then… I traveled by bus through Mexico.

OFFICER: And how did you enter the United States?

APPLICANT: I… I crossed the border.

OFFICER: Where did you cross the border?

APPLICANT: Near… near Tijuana.

OFFICER: Did you enter legally or illegally?

APPLICANT: Illegally.

OFFICER: Do you have any documents to support your claims of persecution?

APPLICANT: No. I didn't… I didn't bring anything with me. I was too afraid to take anything that might identify me.

OFFICER: Not even your Master's degree?

APPLICANT: No. I left everything behind.

OFFICER: What are your plans if you are granted asylum in the United States?

APPLICANT: I want to work. I want to use my skills to… to build a new life. I am a civil engineer. I can contribute to this country.

OFFICER: Given your education and experience, why haven't you been able to find suitable employment in El Salvador? The UCA is a reputable university. Many graduates go on to have successful careers.

APPLICANT: (Silence) It’s just… very difficult there.

OFFICER: Ms. Rodriguez, do you have any questions for me?

APPLICANT: No, I don't think so.

OFFICER: Okay. Thank you for your time, Ms. Rodriguez. I will now review the information you have provided. You will be notified of the decision in writing.

APPLICANT: Thank you, Officer Miller.
