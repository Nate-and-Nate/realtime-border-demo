INTERVIEW BEGINS

OFFICER: Good morning. My name is Officer Miller, and I am an Asylum Officer with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. This is an interview regarding your application for asylum in the United States. Do you understand?

APPLICANT: Yes, I understand. Good morning.

OFFICER: Before we begin, I need to swear you in. Please raise your right hand and repeat after me: "Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?"

APPLICANT: I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God.

OFFICER: Thank you. Please be seated. I have reviewed your application, Form I-589, Application for Asylum and Withholding of Removal. I am going to ask you questions to clarify the information you provided and to gather more details. Please answer my questions as truthfully and completely as possible. Do you understand?

APPLICANT: Yes, I understand.

OFFICER: Okay. Let's start with some background information. Can you please state your full name and date of birth for the record?

APPLICANT: My name is Fatima al-Amin, and my date of birth is October 15, 1962.

OFFICER: And you are a citizen of Syria?

APPLICANT: Yes, I am Syrian.

OFFICER: In your application, you indicated that you are seeking asylum based on fear of persecution due to your race. Can you elaborate on that? What race are you referring to?

APPLICANT: Yes. I… I am… well, my family is… Circassian. It’s a… a minority in Syria. Not Arab.

OFFICER: Circassian. Okay. And you believe you have been persecuted, or fear you will be persecuted, because you are Circassian?

APPLICANT: Yes. Because of that, and… because I am… different. I am… non-binary.

OFFICER: You stated on your application you have one dependent family member. Who is that?

APPLICANT: My son, Omar. He is 28.

OFFICER: He is also in the United States?

APPLICANT: Yes, he is. He came with me.

OFFICER: Let’s go back to the persecution you fear. Can you describe the specific incidents of persecution you experienced or witnessed in Syria that led you to fear for your safety? Please be as detailed as possible, including dates, locations, and individuals involved.

APPLICANT: It’s… difficult to talk about. Many times, it happened. Before the war, it was… whispers, insults. People saying we were not real Syrians, that we were Russians. They called us names… dirty names. I worked in a café… and people would refuse to be served by me. They would say… Circassians are… untrustworthy.

OFFICER: Can you give me a specific example of when this happened at the cafe, including the approximate date and what exactly was said?

APPLICANT: Hmm… It was… maybe 2008? I don't remember the exact date. It was… a man came in, and he asked for coffee. When I brought it, he looked at me and said, "I don't want coffee from a Russian spy." Then he threw the coffee on the floor and left. The owner of the café… he didn't say anything. He just cleaned it up.

OFFICER: Did you report this to the police?

APPLICANT: No. What would they do? They are Arab, too. They wouldn’t care.

OFFICER: You mentioned that things got worse after the war started. Can you describe how the war impacted your situation as a Circassian?

APPLICANT: After the war… everything was chaos. People were fighting each other. The government… they didn't care about protecting anyone. They were too busy fighting the rebels. And… extremist groups… they started targeting minorities. They saw us as… infidels. Also, because I am… non-binary… people… men… they would stare. They would… say things.

OFFICER: Can you give me a specific example of when you were threatened or harmed because of your gender identity?

APPLICANT: One time… maybe 2014… I was walking home from the market in Damascus. A group of men… they stopped me. They started yelling at me… calling me names. They said I was… an abomination. They… they pushed me to the ground. They kicked me. I was… very scared.

OFFICER: Did you report this incident to the police?

APPLICANT: No. The police… they are not safe either. They would probably do the same thing.

OFFICER: You said this happened in Damascus. Did you consider moving to another part of Syria, perhaps a place where there were more Circassians or where you felt safer?

APPLICANT: Yes, I thought about it. But… where could I go? All of Syria was dangerous. My family… my parents… they lived in Damascus. I couldn't leave them.

OFFICER: Where are your parents now?

APPLICANT: They… they died. A few years ago. My mother from sickness, and my father… in the war.

OFFICER: I’m sorry to hear that. What about other family members? Do you have any siblings, aunts, uncles, or cousins?

APPLICANT: I have… a cousin. He lives in Germany. He has citizenship there.

OFFICER: Did you consider seeking refuge in Germany with your cousin?

APPLICANT: I… I thought about it. But… it was too difficult to get there. And… I didn't want to be a burden to him. Plus, my son, Omar, he wanted to come to America. He heard it was a good place for opportunities.

OFFICER: Let's talk about your education and work experience. You indicated on your application that you have primary education. Can you tell me what that entails in Syria? How many years of schooling did you complete?

APPLICANT: Primary school… it’s like… six years. I finished that. But… I didn't go to secondary school. We didn't have money. I had to work to help my family.

OFFICER: What kind of work did you do?

APPLICANT: I worked in a café. As a server, cleaner, whatever they needed. Before that, I helped my mother with sewing.

OFFICER: How long did you work at the café?

APPLICANT: For… maybe 20 years. On and off. Sometimes there was no work. Sometimes the café closed.

OFFICER: In your asylum application, you stated that you fear persecution due to your race and gender identity. However, you also mentioned the general chaos and violence of the war in Syria. Can you clarify whether you fear persecution specifically *because* you are Circassian and non-binary, or whether you fear the general violence that affects all Syrians?

APPLICANT: It’s… both. The war made it worse. But… even before the war, I was… different. I was always… targeted. Because of who I am. The war just gave people an excuse to be more… violent.

OFFICER: Do you have any documents or other evidence to support your claims of persecution, such as police reports, medical records, or witness statements?

APPLICANT: No. I didn't report anything to the police. And… I didn't go to the doctor. I was too scared. I didn't want to draw attention to myself. I have… some pictures. Of me… after the attack. But… they are not very clear.

OFFICER: You mentioned you worked in a café. Do you have any documents to prove your employment, such as pay stubs or a letter from your employer?

APPLICANT: No. I didn't have anything like that. It was… a small café. They paid me in cash.

OFFICER: Let's talk about your journey to the United States. When did you leave Syria, and what route did you take?

APPLICANT: We left Syria in… 2021. We went to Lebanon first. Then to Turkey. Then… to Mexico. And then… we crossed the border into the United States.

OFFICER: How long were you in each of those countries?

APPLICANT: We were in Lebanon for… maybe three months. And Turkey for… six months. Mexico… only a few weeks.

OFFICER: How did you afford to travel to all these countries?

APPLICANT: We… we sold everything we had. Our house. Our furniture. Everything. And… my cousin in Germany… he helped us with some money.

OFFICER: You said you sold your house. Do you have any documentation to prove that you owned a house in Syria?

APPLICANT: No. It was… my parents' house. I didn't have any papers.

OFFICER: In your application, you indicated that you entered the United States legally. Can you explain how you entered legally if you crossed the border from Mexico?

APPLICANT: Oh. Maybe… I misunderstood the question. We… we crossed the border… without permission.

OFFICER: Thank you for clarifying that. What are your plans if you are granted asylum in the United States?

APPLICANT: I want to work. I want to be safe. I want my son to have a good life. I can… cook. I can clean. I can work in a café again.

OFFICER: You mentioned your son, Omar. What does he do for work?

APPLICANT: He… he is looking for work. He is a good worker. He can do anything.

OFFICER: Does Omar have any skills or experience that would help him find employment?

APPLICANT: He… he knows computers a little bit.

OFFICER: Okay. I have a few more questions about your family ties to citizens. You said you have a cousin who is a citizen of Germany. Has he ever visited you in Syria?

APPLICANT: Yes, he came once. A long time ago. Before the war.

OFFICER: Do you have any other relatives who are citizens or permanent residents of other countries?

APPLICANT: No, just my cousin.

OFFICER: Okay, Ms. al-Amin. I'm going to ask you a few more questions to clarify some inconsistencies in your testimony. Earlier, you stated that you sold your house to finance your journey to the United States. However, you also said the house belonged to your parents and you had no ownership documents. Can you explain this discrepancy?

APPLICANT: (Hesitates) Well… it was complicated. After my parents died, the house… it was supposed to be for me and Omar. But… we didn't have official papers. We just… sold it to someone we knew. They gave us money… not the full value, but enough to leave.

OFFICER: So you sold a house you didn't legally own?

APPLICANT: Yes… it was… like that.

OFFICER: You also mentioned an attack in 2014 where you were kicked and verbally assaulted. You said you didn't seek medical attention because you were afraid of drawing attention to yourself. However, you also stated you have pictures of yourself after the attack. If you were afraid of drawing attention, why would you take pictures?

APPLICANT: I… I wanted to have proof. In case… in case I needed it later. But… I didn't want to show anyone.

OFFICER: But you are showing them now, to try and prove your case?

APPLICANT: Yes. Now I need to.

OFFICER: Ms. al-Amin, you stated that you left Syria in 2021 because of persecution. However, you also said that your parents died a few years before that. Can you specify when they died?

APPLICANT: My mother died in… maybe 2018. My father… in 2019.

OFFICER: So, your parents had already passed when you left. Why didn't you leave Syria sooner if you were experiencing persecution and your parents were no longer there to care for?

APPLICANT: (Long pause) It was… difficult to leave. I didn't have money. And… I was scared. I didn't know where to go. I waited until… until Omar convinced me to leave.

OFFICER: One last question. You mentioned that your son knows computers a little bit. Did he receive any formal training in computers?

APPLICANT: No. He just… learned on his own. He is smart.

OFFICER: Ms. al-Amin, do you have anything else you would like to add?

APPLICANT: I just want to be safe. I just want a chance to live in peace.

OFFICER: Thank you, Ms. al-Amin. This interview is now concluded. You will receive a decision on your case in the mail. Do you have any questions for me?

APPLICANT: No, thank you.
