INTERVIEW BEGINS

OFFICER: Good morning, Mr. Silva. My name is Officer Miller, and this is an interview regarding your application for asylum in the United States. I need to explain the process briefly and swear you in before we begin. This interview is conducted under oath, meaning everything you say must be truthful. Are you comfortable proceeding in English, or would you prefer an interpreter?

APPLICANT: Good morning, Officer Miller. I am comfortable speaking in English. Thank you.

OFFICER: Okay, great. Please raise your right hand and repeat after me: "I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God."

APPLICANT: I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God.

OFFICER: Thank you. Please be seated. Before we begin, I want to explain that this is an affirmative asylum case. You have the burden of proving that you meet the requirements for asylum under U.S. law. I will be asking you questions about your background, your reasons for leaving Nicaragua, and your fears about returning. Your answers will be compared to the information in your application and any supporting documents you have provided. Do you understand?

APPLICANT: Yes, Officer Miller, I understand.

OFFICER: Alright, let's start with some background information. Can you please state your full name and date of birth for the record?

APPLICANT: My full name is Ricardo Andres Silva, and my date of birth is July 12, 1991.

OFFICER: And where were you born?

APPLICANT: I was born in Managua, Nicaragua.

OFFICER: Please tell me a bit about your education. You indicated in your application that you have a primary education. Can you elaborate on that?

APPLICANT: Yes. I attended elementary school in Managua. It was a small public school. Due to financial constraints and the need to help support my family, I had to leave after completing the sixth grade. It was a difficult decision, but my family needed the extra income.

OFFICER: So, you completed six years of formal education. Did you receive any other types of training or education after that?

APPLICANT: No formal education, no. But I learned a lot on the job. I started working in my uncle’s small accounting business. I was doing basic bookkeeping and running errands at first. Over time, I learned more about accounting principles and financial management. He taught me everything he knew, really. I became quite proficient, even without the diploma.

OFFICER: Your application mentions a background in business and finance. Can you describe your professional experience in more detail?

APPLICANT: After working for my uncle for a few years, I gained enough experience to get a job at a larger company – a small import/export business. I started as a junior accountant and worked my way up to a senior accounting position. I was responsible for managing the company’s finances, preparing financial statements, and handling tax filings.

OFFICER: What specific skills did you develop in that role?

APPLICANT: I became very proficient in using accounting software, like QuickBooks. I also developed strong analytical skills, being able to identify financial trends and make recommendations to improve the company's profitability. I also became very good at managing cash flow and negotiating with suppliers. It was a challenging but rewarding job.

OFFICER: Okay. Now, let's move on to the reasons why you left Nicaragua. Your application states that you fear persecution based on your membership in a particular social group. Can you tell me more about this group and why you fear persecution?

APPLICANT: Yes. It’s… it’s difficult to explain. It's not a formal group, exactly. It's more of a… a community of people who are involved in small business and entrepreneurial activities in my neighborhood. We would share ideas, help each other out with loans, and… and generally support each other. But because we were becoming successful, we attracted unwanted attention from certain groups and individuals connected to the ruling party. They saw us as a threat to their own economic interests.

OFFICER: Can you be more specific about who these groups or individuals were and what actions they took that made you fear for your safety?

APPLICANT: There was this… group of men, connected to the Sandinistas, I believe. They started showing up at our businesses, demanding "contributions" – basically extortion money. They targeted those of us who were doing well. At first, it was just a few dollars here and there. But it quickly escalated. They became more aggressive, making threats against our families if we didn't pay. They knew where we lived, where our children went to school.

OFFICER: Can you describe a specific incident where you felt threatened?

APPLICANT: Yes. In July of 2022, a group of them came to my workplace. It was during the day. They barged into my office and demanded a large sum of money. When I told them I couldn't pay, they threatened to harm my family. They specifically mentioned my younger sister, Sofia, who was still in school. They knew her name and where she went to school. They said that if I didn't cooperate, something bad would happen to her. I was terrified. I managed to scrape together some money, but I knew it wouldn't be enough to satisfy them.

OFFICER: Did you report this incident to the police?

APPLICANT: No, I didn’t. That’s the problem. The police are often complicit in these activities, or at least turn a blind eye. Reporting it would have put me and my family at even greater risk. Everyone knows that.

OFFICER: Did similar incidents happen to other members of this… informal business community?

APPLICANT: Yes, absolutely. My friend, Miguel, who owned a small bakery, was beaten badly when he refused to pay. His bakery was vandalized, and he eventually had to close it down. Another friend, Elena, who ran a small clothing store, was sexually assaulted by one of these men after she refused to give them money. It was… it was a reign of terror.

OFFICER: Did you personally witness these incidents, or did you hear about them from others?

APPLICANT: I heard about Elena’s assault directly from her. Miguel, I saw him after he was beaten. He was badly bruised. He didn't want to talk about it, but it was clear what had happened.

OFFICER: After the incident at your workplace in July 2022, what did you do?

APPLICANT: I started making plans to leave the country. I knew I couldn't stay there any longer. I feared for my life and the safety of my family. I started selling some of my belongings to raise money for travel expenses.

OFFICER: Did you consider relocating to another part of Nicaragua instead of leaving the country altogether?

APPLICANT: Yes, I did. But it wasn't a realistic option. These groups operate throughout the country. They have connections everywhere. Moving to another city would only delay the inevitable. Besides, my family was also targeted. It wasn't just about me.

OFFICER: So, your family was also aware of these threats?

APPLICANT: Yes. They were terrified. They understood that leaving was the only way to protect ourselves.

OFFICER: What specific fears do you have about returning to Nicaragua now?

APPLICANT: I fear that I will be arrested and imprisoned, or worse. These groups have a long memory. They won't forget that I resisted them, even for a short time. I also fear for the safety of my family. If I return, they will be at risk as well.

OFFICER: What evidence do you have to support your claims of persecution?

APPLICANT: I have submitted several documents with my application, including news articles about the increasing violence and corruption in Nicaragua. I also have affidavits from friends and family members who can corroborate my story. I also have the police report that Miguel eventually filed, even though he was afraid to do so.

OFFICER: Let’s talk about your family. You mentioned your younger sister, Sofia. Where is she now?

APPLICANT: She is still in Nicaragua, living with my parents. I worry about her every day.

OFFICER: Are your parents aware of your asylum application?

APPLICANT: Yes, they are. They support my decision, even though it means we are separated. They understand that I had no other choice.

OFFICER: How did you travel to the United States?

APPLICANT: I flew from Managua to Mexico City. Then, I traveled by bus to the U.S.-Mexico border. I entered the United States legally with a tourist visa.

OFFICER: When did you arrive in the United States?

APPLICANT: I arrived on March 15, 2023.

OFFICER: What are your plans if you are granted asylum in the United States?

APPLICANT: I want to build a new life here. I want to use my skills and experience to contribute to society. I am a hard worker, and I am eager to learn. I believe I can make a positive impact. I would like to find a job in accounting or finance. I am also willing to pursue further education to improve my skills. I understand there's a shortage of qualified accountants here, and I believe my skills would be valuable.

OFFICER: You mentioned a shortage of accountants. Are you aware of any specific initiatives or programs that address this shortage?

APPLICANT: Yes, I have done some research. I know that there are scholarships and training programs available for people interested in pursuing careers in accounting and finance. I would be interested in exploring those opportunities if I am granted asylum. I believe I can quickly adapt and become a valuable member of the workforce.

OFFICER: You mentioned you entered the US legally with a tourist visa. What were your intentions when you first entered the US?

APPLICANT: Honestly, Officer, at first I was hoping the situation in Nicaragua would improve. I came with the intention of visiting and assessing the possibilities of perhaps working here temporarily, maybe finding a short-term job. But after a few weeks, speaking with my family back home, the situation deteriorated further. The threats became more direct, more frequent. It became clear that returning was not an option. That's when I decided to apply for asylum.

OFFICER: I see. Now, let's delve a little deeper into your educational background. You mentioned that you had to leave school after the sixth grade due to financial constraints. Can you describe the circumstances that led to that decision?

APPLICANT: My father was a construction worker, and my mother worked as a seamstress. They struggled to make ends meet. When my grandfather became ill, the medical expenses became overwhelming. I was the eldest of four children, so I felt a responsibility to help support my family. Leaving school was a difficult decision, but it was necessary.

OFFICER: Did you ever consider returning to school later in life?

APPLICANT: Yes, I did. I always regretted not finishing my education. I tried to take some night classes, but it was difficult to balance work and studies. I hope to be able to get some certifications now that I am here and can work without fear.

OFFICER: That’s understandable. Do you have any questions for me at this time?

APPLICANT: No, Officer Miller. Thank you for your time and consideration.

OFFICER: Thank you, Mr. Silva. I am now going to review your case and all supporting evidence. I will let you know when a decision has been made.
