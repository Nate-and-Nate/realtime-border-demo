INTERVIEW BEGINS

OFFICER: Good morning, Mr. Aung. My name is Officer Miller, and I'm an asylum officer with USCIS. I'm here today to conduct an interview regarding your application for asylum. Before we begin, I need to inform you that this interview is conducted under oath. Please raise your right hand and repeat after me: "I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God."

APPLICANT: I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God.

OFFICER: Thank you. I understand that you do not have legal representation today. Do you understand that you have the right to an attorney, and that you can postpone this interview to obtain one?

APPLICANT: Yes, Officer. I understand. I have chosen to proceed without one. I believe I can explain my situation clearly.

OFFICER: Alright. I also want to inform you that this interview is being recorded. The information you provide will be used to determine your eligibility for asylum. Do you understand?

APPLICANT: Yes, I understand.

OFFICER: Okay, Mr. Aung. Let's start with some background information. Can you please state your full name and date of birth for the record?

APPLICANT: My full name is Aung San Myint, and my date of birth is March 12, 1965.

OFFICER: And can you please confirm your nationality?

APPLICANT: I am a citizen of Myanmar.

OFFICER: You indicated on your application that you have a Bachelor's degree. Can you tell me what you studied and where you obtained your degree?

APPLICANT: Yes, I have a Bachelor of Science in Physics from Yangon University. I completed my studies in 1987. It was a four-year program. A very difficult program, but I was very dedicated to my studies.

OFFICER: And what did you do after graduating with your degree?

APPLICANT: After graduating, I worked as a research scientist at the Myanmar Science and Technology Research Institute in Yangon. I specialized in materials science. I was involved in research projects related to renewable energy and improving the efficiency of solar panels.

OFFICER: That's interesting. Can you elaborate on the type of research you were conducting?

APPLICANT: Certainly. My team focused on developing new materials for solar cells, specifically trying to improve their light absorption and energy conversion rates. We were also exploring the use of nanotechnology to enhance the performance of these materials. It was very cutting edge research, and I was very passionate about it.

OFFICER: And how long did you work there?

APPLICANT: I worked at the Institute for nearly 25 years, until 2012.

OFFICER: And what did you do after 2012?

APPLICANT: After 2012, the political situation started to become very difficult. The government began to exert more control over research and development. They wanted to direct our research towards projects that served their political agenda, rather than focusing on purely scientific advancement. I refused to comply with these directives. I felt it was unethical to compromise the integrity of my research for political gain. Because of my refusal, I faced increasing pressure and eventually, I was forced to resign.

OFFICER: Can you describe this pressure in more detail?

APPLICANT: Yes. Initially, it was subtle. I was excluded from important meetings, my research proposals were repeatedly rejected, and I was given less funding than my colleagues. Then, it became more direct. I was summoned to meetings with government officials who pressured me to align my research with their political goals. They threatened to cut off funding for the entire Institute if I didn't cooperate. When I still refused, they began to spread rumors about me, accusing me of being disloyal to the government and of undermining national security.

OFFICER: Did you experience any direct threats or harassment?

APPLICANT: Yes, I did. On several occasions, I was followed by plainclothes officers. My phone was tapped, and my email was monitored. I received anonymous phone calls with veiled threats against me and my family. It was a very stressful and frightening time.

OFFICER: You mentioned that the political situation started to become difficult. Can you tell me more about that? What were your political opinions, and how did they conflict with the government's?

APPLICANT: I have always been a strong advocate for democracy and human rights. I believed that Myanmar should be a free and open society, where all citizens have the right to express their opinions without fear of reprisal. I was openly critical of the military regime and its human rights abuses. I participated in peaceful protests and signed petitions calling for democratic reforms. I also used my position as a scientist to advocate for evidence-based policymaking, which often clashed with the government's authoritarian approach.

OFFICER: Can you give me a specific example of how your advocacy for evidence-based policymaking clashed with the government's approach?

APPLICANT: Yes. One instance was related to a large-scale dam project on the Irrawaddy River. The government was pushing ahead with the project despite serious concerns about its environmental impact and its potential to displace thousands of people. I used my scientific expertise to analyze the environmental impact assessment report, and I found it to be deeply flawed. I publicly criticized the report and called for a more thorough and independent assessment. This angered government officials, who accused me of trying to sabotage the project and undermining national development.

OFFICER: After you resigned from the Institute, what did you do?

APPLICANT: After resigning, I tried to find other employment, but it was very difficult. My reputation had been tarnished by the government's smear campaign. I was blacklisted from many institutions. Eventually, I found a teaching position at a small private college in Mandalay. But even there, I was constantly under surveillance and faced harassment from government agents.

OFFICER: Can you describe the harassment you experienced at the college?

APPLICANT: Yes. The local authorities frequently visited the college to monitor my lectures and activities. They questioned my students about my political views and tried to intimidate them into providing negative information about me. I was also denied opportunities for promotion and professional development. The college administration, fearing government reprisal, was reluctant to support me.

OFFICER: Did you report these incidents to the authorities?

APPLICANT: No, I did not. Reporting to the authorities would have been futile and dangerous. The authorities themselves were the ones persecuting me. I had no faith that they would protect me. In fact, I feared that reporting them would only make my situation worse.

OFFICER: Did you consider relocating to another part of Myanmar to escape the persecution?

APPLICANT: Yes, I did. I considered moving to a rural area, where I might be less visible to the government. However, I knew that the government's reach extended throughout the country. No place in Myanmar was truly safe for me. Moreover, I have a family â€“ my wife and three children. Moving would mean uprooting them and exposing them to the same risks.

OFFICER: Tell me about your family. Are they with you in the United States?

APPLICANT: No, they are not. They are still in Myanmar. This is the most difficult part for me. I am constantly worried about their safety.

OFFICER: Are they also at risk because of your political opinions?

APPLICANT: Yes, absolutely. They have already faced harassment and intimidation because of my activities. My wife has been questioned by the authorities, and my children have been bullied at school. I fear that if I return to Myanmar, the government will target my family even more severely.

OFFICER: What is your wife's name and date of birth?

APPLICANT: Her name is Htin Htin Aye, and her date of birth is June 15, 1968.

OFFICER: And your children's names and dates of birth?

APPLICANT: My eldest son, Zaw Min Aung, was born on October 20, 1992. My daughter, Aye Thandar Aung, was born on April 5, 1995. And my youngest son, Kyaw Swar Aung, was born on January 12, 1998.

OFFICER: Okay. Mr. Aung, can you describe the specific incident that led you to finally leave Myanmar?

APPLICANT: Yes. In late 2022, I was arrested during a peaceful protest against the military coup. I was detained for several days and subjected to brutal interrogation. The authorities accused me of inciting unrest and spreading misinformation. They threatened to imprison me for many years. While in detention, I witnessed other political prisoners being tortured and abused. It was a horrific experience. I realized that my life was in imminent danger. After I was released, I knew that I had to leave the country immediately.

OFFICER: Can you describe the interrogation in more detail? What specific questions were you asked, and what kind of treatment did you experience?

APPLICANT: They asked me about my involvement in the protests, who organized them, and who funded them. They wanted me to name other activists and provide information about their activities. I refused to cooperate. They beat me repeatedly with batons, and they deprived me of food and water for long periods. They also threatened to harm my family if I didn't cooperate.

OFFICER: After your release, how did you leave Myanmar?

APPLICANT: I was able to obtain a tourist visa for Thailand. I flew from Yangon to Bangkok. From there, I traveled to Mexico and then crossed the border into the United States.

OFFICER: When did you enter the United States?

APPLICANT: I entered the United States on March 10, 2023.

OFFICER: And how did you enter?

APPLICANT: I crossed the border near Tijuana.

OFFICER: Did you have any trouble entering?

APPLICANT: Yes, I was apprehended by border patrol officers. I immediately expressed my intention to seek asylum.

OFFICER: Mr. Aung, why canâ€™t you return to Myanmar?

APPLICANT: I cannot return to Myanmar because I fear for my life. The government considers me an enemy of the state. I have been blacklisted, harassed, and arrested. I have witnessed the brutal treatment of other political prisoners. If I return, I am certain that I will be imprisoned, tortured, or even killed. Furthermore, my family would be at great risk. They would be targeted by the government as a way to punish me. I cannot expose them to such danger.

OFFICER: What evidence have you submitted to support your asylum claim?

APPLICANT: I have submitted several documents, including: a copy of my university diploma, letters of recommendation from former colleagues, news articles about my political activism, photographs of me participating in protests, a medical report documenting the injuries I sustained during my detention, and a report from Amnesty International documenting human rights abuses in Myanmar. I also submitted affidavits from friends and colleagues who can attest to my political activities and the persecution I have faced.

OFFICER: Do you have any concerns about your family in Myanmar that you would like to reiterate?

APPLICANT: Yes. My greatest concern is for the safety and well-being of my wife and children. I am worried that the government will target them because of my asylum application. I plead with you to consider their situation and to do everything possible to protect them. If I am granted asylum, I hope to be able to bring them to the United States as soon as possible.

OFFICER: If granted asylum, what are your plans for the future?

APPLICANT: If granted asylum, I want to rebuild my life in the United States and contribute to society. I am a highly skilled scientist with many years of experience in research and development. I am confident that I can find employment in my field and make a positive contribution to the American economy. I also want to continue to advocate for democracy and human rights in Myanmar. I believe that it is my moral obligation to speak out against injustice and to support those who are fighting for freedom.

OFFICER: Mr. Aung, you mentioned your educational background. The United States has a need for people with STEM skills. How do you think your skills could be used here?

APPLICANT: I believe my skills in materials science, particularly my experience with renewable energy technologies, could be very valuable here. I am eager to work on developing more efficient and sustainable energy solutions. I am also proficient in data analysis and modeling, which are skills that are in high demand in many industries. I am confident that I can quickly adapt to the American work environment and make a significant contribution.

OFFICER: Do you have any further comments or anything else you would like to add?

APPLICANT: I just want to reiterate that I am telling the truth. I am genuinely afraid to return to Myanmar. My life and the lives of my family members are at risk. I am seeking asylum in the United States because I believe it is the only way to protect myself and my family from persecution. I am grateful for the opportunity to present my case, and I hope that you will grant me asylum.

OFFICER: Thank you, Mr. Aung. I have no further questions for you at this time. We will review your application and the information you have provided, and we will notify you of our decision in writing.

APPLICANT: Thank you, Officer.
