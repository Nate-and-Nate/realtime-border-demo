INTERVIEW BEGINS

OFFICER: Good morning, Ms. Rodriguez. My name is Officer Miller, and my employee number is AO-6662. This is a defensive asylum interview. As you know, you are currently in removal proceedings, and you are applying for asylum as a defense against being deported back to Cuba. I need to inform you that I am recording this interview, and it will be used to make a decision on your case. Everything you say must be truthful. Do you understand?

APPLICANT: Yes, I understand.

OFFICER: I am also required to administer an oath. Please raise your right hand and repeat after me: “I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God.”

APPLICANT: I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God.

OFFICER: Thank you. Please be seated. Before we begin, I see that you have indicated on your I-589 form that you do not have legal representation. Is that still the case?

APPLICANT: Yes, that is correct. I do not have a lawyer.

OFFICER: Alright. I will do my best to explain everything clearly. We'll start with some basic information about yourself. Can you please state your full name and date of birth for the record?

APPLICANT: My name is Elena Maria Rodriguez Garcia, and my date of birth is March 10, 2000.

OFFICER: And what is your address in the United States?

APPLICANT: 14 Oak Street, Apartment 2B, Miami, Florida.

OFFICER: Ms. Rodriguez, your application states that you are seeking asylum based on a fear of persecution due to gender-based violence in Cuba. Is that correct?

APPLICANT: Yes, that is correct.

OFFICER: Alright, let's start by understanding your background a bit better. Can you tell me about your life in Cuba before you came to the United States? Where did you live, and what was your daily life like?

APPLICANT: I lived in Havana, mostly. I grew up there, went to school there… my life was… difficult. I lived with my mother and my grandmother. My father… he left when I was very young. I studied a lot, always.

OFFICER: You mentioned studying. Your application indicates that you have a Doctoral degree. Can you tell me more about your education? Where did you study, and what was your field of study?

APPLICANT: Yes, I have a doctorate in… Sociology. I studied at the University of Havana. It was… very challenging, but I am proud of what I achieved.

OFFICER: A doctorate in Sociology is quite impressive. Can you explain what specifically you were studying, and what your research focused on?

APPLICANT: My research focused on gender inequality in the Cuban workforce, specifically in the tourism sector. I looked at the disparities in pay and opportunities for women compared to men, and the impact of societal expectations on women's career paths.

OFFICER: Did your research or your views on gender inequality cause you any problems in Cuba?

APPLICANT: Indirectly, yes. Speaking about these things, even in academic settings, can be… uncomfortable. There is a lot of pressure to conform. But the bigger problem was… well, it was more personal.

OFFICER: You mentioned that you also worked in the service industry. Can you elaborate on your work experience?

APPLICANT: Yes, I worked as a waitress and bartender at a few different tourist restaurants and bars in Old Havana to support myself while I was studying. It was… hard work, long hours, and the pay was not great. But it was necessary.

OFFICER: Now, let's move on to the reasons why you left Cuba. Can you describe the specific incidents of persecution or threats that you experienced or witnessed that led you to fear for your safety?

APPLICANT: It started with… unwanted attention at work. The managers, some of the customers… they would make comments, touch me without my permission. It was constant. I reported it to the police once, but they did nothing. They said I was overreacting, that it was just “part of the job.”

OFFICER: Can you give me a specific example of an incident that occurred? Include the date, if you can remember, and the location, as well as who was involved.

APPLICANT: It was… maybe around June of 2022. I was working at a bar called "El Rumbo." A tourist, I think he was from Spain, he kept insisting I have a drink with him. I told him no, many times. He grabbed my arm and tried to pull me closer. I pulled away, and he started yelling at me, calling me names… very vulgar things. The manager just watched. He did nothing to help me.

OFFICER: And after that incident, what happened? Did the harassment continue?

APPLICANT: Yes, it continued. And it escalated. There was another incident, a few months later, where I was walking home from work late at night. A man… he followed me. He grabbed me and tried to… he tried to force himself on me. I fought him off, but he threatened me. He said he knew where I lived, that he would be back.

OFFICER: Did you report that incident to the police?

APPLICANT: Yes, I did. But again, they did nothing. They took my statement, but they didn't investigate. They said it was my fault for being out so late.

OFFICER: Were these incidents the only reasons you feared for your safety, or were there other factors?

APPLICANT: It wasn't just the individual incidents. It was the constant feeling of being unsafe, of being vulnerable. The police wouldn't help, and the societal attitudes… it felt like everyone was against me. Also, my cousin, Maria, she experienced something similar. She was… assaulted. And the police… they blamed her. I saw what happened to her, and I knew I had to leave.

OFFICER: Did you try to relocate to a different part of Cuba to escape the harassment?

APPLICANT: I considered it, but I didn't have the resources. I was barely making enough money to support myself and my family. And even if I had moved, I didn't think it would make a difference. The same attitudes, the same lack of protection… it's everywhere in Cuba.

OFFICER: You mentioned you support your family. Who are the members of your family, and are they also at risk?

APPLICANT: It's just my mother and my grandmother. My grandmother is very old and sick. My mother works as a cleaner, but it is not enough to pay for medicine and food. I send them money when I can. And yes, I believe they are at risk because of me. If I am seen as an enemy of the state, for speaking out, for leaving… they could be targeted.

OFFICER: What evidence do you have to support your claims of persecution and fear?

APPLICANT: I have submitted… a copy of the police report from the second incident, although it doesn't say much. I also have… letters from my mother and Maria describing their experiences and confirming the threats I received. And I have my doctoral dissertation, which shows my research on gender inequality in Cuba.

OFFICER: Let's talk about your travel to the United States. Can you describe your journey, including the route you took, the timeline, and how you entered the country?

APPLICANT: I flew to… Mexico, to Cancun. Then, I traveled by land to the border with the United States. I crossed the border… illegally. I know it was wrong, but I didn't see any other way. I was afraid to apply for a visa because I thought they would deny me. It took about two weeks, the whole journey.

OFFICER: When did you enter the United States?

APPLICANT: June 15, 2023.

OFFICER: Your application states that you fear returning to Cuba. Can you explain in detail why you cannot return?

APPLICANT: Because… I am afraid for my life. I am afraid of being harassed, assaulted, and not being protected by the authorities. I am afraid of being targeted for my views on gender equality and for speaking out against the government. I am afraid for my family, that they will be punished because of me. I believe the man who attacked me is still out there. If I go back, I am sure he will find me. I have no protection there.

OFFICER: What are your plans if you are granted asylum in the United States?

APPLICANT: I want to… find a job, any job, to support myself and my family. Eventually, I would like to use my education and skills to work in a field related to sociology or gender studies. I want to contribute to society and make a positive impact. I also want to learn English better.

OFFICER: You mentioned your doctoral degree. Have you looked into options for validating your credentials in the United States?

APPLICANT: I have done some research online, but I am not sure where to start. I know it will be difficult and expensive. But I am willing to do whatever it takes.

OFFICER: Ms. Rodriguez, I'm going to ask you a few questions about your I-589 form. On page 5, question 3, you answered "No" to the question: "Have you, your relatives, or close friends ever helped, supported, or participated in any armed resistance group, or any other group using violence?" Can you confirm that this is accurate?

APPLICANT: Yes, that is accurate. I have never been involved in any violent groups.

OFFICER: On page 7, you listed your mother and grandmother as dependents. Have they ever been members of the Communist Party in Cuba?

APPLICANT: My mother… she was a member of the Party when she was younger, because it was required for her job. But she is not active anymore. My grandmother… she has never been a member.

OFFICER: Okay. Now, going back to your research on gender inequality, can you provide me with a specific example of a policy or practice in Cuba that contributes to this inequality?

APPLICANT: Yes. While the Cuban constitution guarantees equal pay for equal work, in practice, women are often relegated to lower-paying jobs in the tourism sector, such as housekeeping or waitressing, while men dominate management positions. Additionally, there is a lack of affordable childcare, which disproportionately affects women's ability to pursue higher education or career advancement.

OFFICER: I noticed that you have a very good vocabulary for someone who claims to have intermediate English proficiency. How did you learn English?

APPLICANT: I studied English in school, but mostly I learned from watching movies and TV shows with subtitles. And from talking to tourists at the bar where I worked.

OFFICER: Ms. Rodriguez, thank you for your testimony today. I will review your application and the evidence you have submitted, and you will be notified of the decision in writing. Do you have any questions for me?

APPLICANT: No, I don't think so. Thank you for listening.

OFFICER: You're welcome.
