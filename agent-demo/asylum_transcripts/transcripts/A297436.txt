INTERVIEW BEGINS

OFFICER: Good morning, Mr. Vargas. My name is Officer Miller, and I'm an asylum officer with USCIS. This interview is to determine if you are eligible for asylum in the United States. With me today is your attorney, Ms. Rodriguez.

APPLICANT: Good morning, Officer Miller. Yes, and good morning, Ms. Rodriguez.

OFFICER: Ms. Rodriguez, do you confirm you are representing Mr. Vargas in this matter?

ATTORNEY: Yes, Officer, I do.

OFFICER: Mr. Vargas, I need to inform you that this interview is being recorded, and everything you say will be under oath. Please raise your right hand and repeat after me: "I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God."

APPLICANT: I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God.

OFFICER: Thank you. Please be seated. Before we begin, do you understand that you can ask me to clarify any question if you don't understand it?

APPLICANT: Yes, I understand.

OFFICER: Okay. Let’s start with some background information. Could you please state your full name and date of birth for the record?

APPLICANT: My full name is Ricardo Vargas Martinez, and my date of birth is July 12, 1974.

OFFICER: And your current address in the United States?

APPLICANT: It is 14 Oak Street, Apartment 2B, Anytown, USA.

OFFICER: Thank you. Now, Mr. Vargas, let’s talk about your life in Nicaragua. Where in Nicaragua were you born and raised?

APPLICANT: I was born and raised in Managua, the capital city.

OFFICER: What is the highest level of education you completed?

APPLICANT: I completed secondary education. High school, you would say.

OFFICER: And what kind of work did you do in Nicaragua?

APPLICANT: Well, I… I was mostly unemployed. I did odd jobs. Sometimes construction, sometimes helping friends with their businesses. Nothing… consistent.

OFFICER: Can you be more specific? What kind of construction work? And what kind of businesses?

APPLICANT: Construction… mostly manual labor. Carrying materials, mixing cement. With my friends, one had a small shop selling clothes, I would help him sometimes with inventory, or cleaning. Another had a small food stall, I helped him prepare food sometimes.

OFFICER: So, you don’t have any specific skills or training in any particular field?

APPLICANT: No, not really. Just… general labor.

OFFICER: Your application states that you fear persecution due to your political opinion. Can you tell me about that? What political opinions do you hold, and how did you express them in Nicaragua?

APPLICANT: I… I opposed the current government. I believed they were corrupt and… and authoritarian. I would talk about it with my friends and family.

OFFICER: Did you participate in any political demonstrations or protests?

APPLICANT: No, not really. I was afraid.

OFFICER: So, you expressed your opinions only in private conversations?

APPLICANT: Yes, mostly.

OFFICER: Your application mentions an incident where you were threatened. Can you describe that incident in detail?

APPLICANT: Yes. It was… maybe six months before I left Nicaragua. I was walking home from a friend’s house, and two men stopped me. They were wearing plain clothes, but they looked like… like government security. They said, “We know what you’re saying about the government. You need to be careful.” They pushed me around a little, but they didn’t seriously hurt me.

OFFICER: Can you describe these men? What did they look like?

APPLICANT: They were… tall, muscular. One had a scar on his face. I don’t remember exactly what they looked like, it was dark, and I was scared.

OFFICER: Did they identify themselves as government officials?

APPLICANT: No, they didn’t say they were. But I just… I knew. The way they looked, the way they acted…

OFFICER: Did you report this incident to the police?

APPLICANT: No! Are you kidding? The police are part of the problem. They are controlled by the government.

OFFICER: Why did you assume they were government security if they didn’t identify themselves?

APPLICANT: Because… because everyone knows that the government uses plainclothes officers to intimidate people. It's common knowledge.

OFFICER: Did you see these men before or after this incident?

APPLICANT: No, never.

OFFICER: Okay. Your application also mentions that your brother was arrested for protesting. Can you tell me about that?

APPLICANT: Yes, my brother, Miguel. He… he was arrested during a protest against the government’s policies. I think it was about land rights, something like that.

OFFICER: When was this?

APPLICANT: It was… maybe a year before I left. I don’t remember the exact date.

OFFICER: What happened to him?

APPLICANT: He was held for a few days, then released. He was beaten, I think. He didn't talk much about it.

OFFICER: Did he have any lasting injuries? Did he require medical treatment?

APPLICANT: He… he was sore. I think he had some bruises. He didn’t go to the doctor.

OFFICER: Do you have any documentation related to your brother's arrest?

APPLICANT: No. I… I didn’t think to get any. He didn't want to make a fuss.

OFFICER: After your brother was arrested and you were threatened, did you try to relocate within Nicaragua?

APPLICANT: No. I thought it was too dangerous. The government’s influence is everywhere.

OFFICER: Why didn't your brother apply for asylum?

APPLICANT: He… he doesn't want to leave Nicaragua. He says it is his home, and he will stay and fight.

OFFICER: Okay. Let’s talk about your departure from Nicaragua. When did you leave, and how did you get to the United States?

APPLICANT: I left in… in October of last year. I flew to… to Mexico, and then crossed the border.

OFFICER: What date in October?

APPLICANT: I... I think it was October 15th, or 16th. I am not certain.

OFFICER: And how did you cross the border?

APPLICANT: With… with a coyote.

OFFICER: How much did you pay the coyote?

APPLICANT: I paid him… $5,000.

OFFICER: Where did you get that money?

APPLICANT: I… I sold some things. And my family helped me.

OFFICER: What things did you sell?

APPLICANT: Some… some furniture, some jewelry.

OFFICER: Do you have any receipts or documentation of these sales?

APPLICANT: No, I don't. They were… informal sales.

OFFICER: Why did you choose to come to the United States?

APPLICANT: Because… because I heard it was safe here. And that I could get asylum.

OFFICER: What do you plan to do if you are granted asylum in the United States?

APPLICANT: I… I want to work. I want to contribute to society.

OFFICER: You mentioned you have experience in construction. Are you looking to pursue that here?

APPLICANT: Yes, maybe. Or… or anything, really. I am willing to work hard.

OFFICER: Mr. Vargas, Nicaragua is currently facing a critical skill shortage in the technology sector. Given your background, how do you see yourself contributing to the U.S. economy in a field that addresses a critical skill shortage?

APPLICANT: I'm sorry, I don't understand. I don't have any experience in technology. I did construction.

OFFICER: But you stated you wanted to find a way to contribute to society and were willing to work hard. This is an area where the U.S. needs skilled workers. Are you willing to get training in this area?

APPLICANT: I suppose… I am willing to learn, but I don’t know anything about computers. It seems… difficult.

OFFICER: Your application states that you fear returning to Nicaragua because the government will target you. Why do you believe they would still be interested in you, given that you were not actively involved in political activities?

APPLICANT: Because… because they know what I think. They know I oppose them. And they will punish me for it.

OFFICER: But you said you only expressed these opinions in private conversations. How would the government know about them?

APPLICANT: I… I don't know exactly. But I am sure they know. They have ways of finding out.

OFFICER: Mr. Vargas, you stated you were threatened by men you believed were government security. Did you recognize these men?

APPLICANT: No, I had never seen them before.

OFFICER: But you were sure they were government security. How could you be sure if you didn't recognize them?

APPLICANT: It was just a feeling I had. The way they acted, the way they looked…

OFFICER: A feeling.

APPLICANT: Yes.

OFFICER: Mr. Vargas, I notice a discrepancy in your application. You state that you have no family members at risk in Nicaragua, but you also mentioned that your brother was arrested for protesting. Wouldn't that put him at risk?

APPLICANT: Well, yes, he is at risk. But… but he doesn't want to leave. He is staying there by choice.

OFFICER: But that doesn’t change the fact that he is at risk because of his political activities, correct?

APPLICANT: I… I guess so.

OFFICER: Ms. Rodriguez, do you have any questions for your client at this time?

ATTORNEY: Yes, Officer. Mr. Vargas, can you tell me more about the general political climate in Nicaragua at the time you left?

APPLICANT: It was very tense. The government was cracking down on dissent. There were reports of people being arrested and disappeared. Everyone was afraid.

ATTORNEY: And how did this climate affect your daily life?

APPLICANT: I was always worried about being watched, about being overheard. I stopped talking about politics, even with my friends. I was living in fear.

OFFICER: Mr. Vargas, you mentioned selling furniture and jewelry to raise money to pay the coyote. Do you have any photographs of these items?

APPLICANT: No, I don't.

OFFICER: Do you have any friends or family members in the United States who can corroborate your story?

APPLICANT: No, I don’t.

OFFICER: Mr. Vargas, based on my review of your application and this interview, I have some concerns about the consistency and credibility of your claims. You stated that you were not actively involved in political activities, yet you claim to fear persecution based on your political opinion. You also stated that you have no family members at risk, despite mentioning your brother's arrest. Furthermore, your account of the threat you received is vague and lacks specific details. Can you explain these inconsistencies?

APPLICANT: I… I don't know what to say. I am telling the truth. I am afraid to go back to Nicaragua.

OFFICER: Mr. Vargas, do you have any other evidence or information that you would like to present at this time?

APPLICANT: No, that is all.

OFFICER: Ms. Rodriguez, do you have any further comments or questions?

ATTORNEY: No, Officer, not at this time.

OFFICER: Okay, Mr. Vargas, this concludes the interview. I will review the information you have provided and make a decision on your case. You will receive a written notice of the decision in the mail. Thank you for your time.

APPLICANT: Thank you, Officer.

ATTORNEY: Thank you.
