OFFICER: Good morning. My name is Officer Miller, and this is an interview regarding your application for asylum in the United States. Thank you for coming in today. Please raise your right hand and repeat after me: "I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God."

APPLICANT: (Raises right hand) I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God.

OFFICER: Thank you. Please be seated. Just to reiterate, this is an affirmative asylum interview. You filed Form I-589, Application for Asylum and for Withholding of Removal, while you are legally present in the United States. I will ask you questions about the information you provided in your application and about your experiences in Myanmar. It's very important that you are honest and forthright in your answers. Do you understand?

APPLICANT: Yes, I understand.

OFFICER: Okay. Let’s begin with your personal information. Please state your full name and date of birth for the record.

APPLICANT: My name is Nyein Maung. My date of birth is March 10, 1963.

OFFICER: And you identify as non-binary?

APPLICANT: Yes, that is correct.

OFFICER: Okay. Can you spell your name for me, please?

APPLICANT: N-Y-E-I-N M-A-U-N-G.

OFFICER: Thank you. Where were you born, Ms. Maung?

APPLICANT: I was born in Yangon, Myanmar.

OFFICER: And what is your current address here in the United States?

APPLICANT: It is 14 Oak Street, Apartment 2B, Anytown, USA.

OFFICER: Now, Ms. Maung, let’s talk about your education. You indicated on your application that you completed primary education. Can you tell me more about that?

APPLICANT: Yes. I went to the local school in my village until I was about… eleven, I think. It was a small school, just a few rooms. We learned basic reading, writing, and some math.

OFFICER: Did you receive any kind of diploma or certificate upon completing your primary education?

APPLICANT: No, nothing like that. It was just… understood that you finished when you stopped going.

OFFICER: And why did you stop going to school at age eleven?

APPLICANT: My family needed me to work. We were very poor. My parents were farmers, but the land was not good. I needed to help earn money.

OFFICER: What kind of work did you do?

APPLICANT: Many things. Mostly helping my mother sell things at the market. Vegetables, sometimes small crafts she made.

OFFICER: Now, let’s move on to your professional experience. You stated that you worked in the service industry. Can you elaborate on that?

APPLICANT: Yes. For many years, I worked at a tea shop in Yangon. It was a small, family-run shop. I helped with everything – serving customers, cleaning, sometimes cooking simple dishes.

OFFICER: How long did you work at the tea shop?

APPLICANT: About… 20 years, I think. From when I was maybe 18 until I was almost 40.

OFFICER: Why did you leave that job?

APPLICANT: The owner, he… he passed away. His children didn't want to run the tea shop anymore, so they closed it.

OFFICER: What did you do after the tea shop closed?

APPLICANT: I worked odd jobs. Cleaning houses, helping at other small shops, whatever I could find. It was difficult.

OFFICER: Ms. Maung, your application states that you are seeking asylum based on a fear of persecution due to your religion. Can you tell me about your religious beliefs?

APPLICANT: I am Buddhist. I believe in… the teachings of Buddha, the path to enlightenment.

OFFICER: And how does your religion put you at risk in Myanmar?

APPLICANT: It’s not just… being Buddhist. It’s also my… my way of being. As a non-binary person. The… the monks, some of them, they… they don’t approve. They say it is against the teachings. They speak out against people like me.

OFFICER: Can you give me a specific example of when you were discriminated against or persecuted because of your religion and your gender identity?

APPLICANT: Yes. It was maybe… three years ago, 2020. I was at the pagoda, praying. And one of the monks, he saw me. He recognized me because I sometimes helped clean the pagoda. He started shouting at me. He said I was an abomination, that I was disrespecting Buddha. He told me to leave and never come back.

OFFICER: Did anyone else witness this incident?

APPLICANT: Yes. There were other people at the pagoda. Some of them… they looked away. Some of them… they agreed with the monk.

OFFICER: Did this happen only once?

APPLICANT: No. It happened several times. Not always the same monk, but… similar things. People would stare, whisper. Sometimes they would say things… hurtful things.

OFFICER: Can you recall any specific phrases or insults that were directed at you?

APPLICANT: They called me… “kathoey,” which is a… a derogatory term for someone who is not male or female. They said I was a disgrace to my family, to my religion. They said I would bring bad luck to the village.

OFFICER: Did you report these incidents to the police or any other authorities?

APPLICANT: No. What would be the point? The police… they don’t care about people like me. Sometimes, they are even worse. They would just laugh or… or worse.

OFFICER: Were you ever physically harmed?

APPLICANT: Not… directly. But… once, some young men followed me home from the market. They threw stones at me. They didn’t hit me, but… it was very frightening.

OFFICER: When was this?

APPLICANT: Maybe… six months before I left Myanmar. So, around… September 2022.

OFFICER: Did you try to relocate to another part of Myanmar to escape this persecution?

APPLICANT: I thought about it. But… where would I go? It’s the same everywhere. People are… the same. And I didn't have money to move and start a new life.

OFFICER: Why can you not return to Myanmar?

APPLICANT: Because… I am afraid. I am afraid they will hurt me, or worse. The… the political situation is also very bad. The military… they are in control. They are very strict. They don’t like people who are different.

OFFICER: You mentioned the political situation. How does the current political climate in Myanmar affect you personally, beyond the religious discrimination you’ve described?

APPLICANT: The military… they are cracking down on everything. There are protests, but they are very dangerous. People are being arrested, even killed. They don’t like anyone who speaks out against them, or who is different. It makes the religious discrimination even worse. Because they see people like me as… weak, as easy targets.

OFFICER: What evidence do you have to support your claims?

APPLICANT: I have… some photos. Of me at the pagoda, before… before the problems started. And… I have a letter from a friend in Myanmar. She… she knows what happened to me. She can… confirm what I have said. I submitted these with my application.

OFFICER: We have those documents. Thank you. Do you have any family members in Myanmar?

APPLICANT: Yes. My sister. She is… older than me. And… some cousins.

OFFICER: Are they also at risk?

APPLICANT: I don’t know. My sister… she is quiet. She doesn’t… stand out. But… I worry about her. Because she is my family.

OFFICER: Let’s talk about your travel to the United States. When did you arrive?

APPLICANT: I arrived… January 15, 2023.

OFFICER: How did you get here?

APPLICANT: I flew. From Yangon to… Bangkok, then to… Tokyo, then to… here.

OFFICER: You entered the United States on a visitor visa, correct?

APPLICANT: Yes, that is correct.

OFFICER: What were your intentions when you applied for and received that visa?

APPLICANT: I… I wanted to visit. I wanted to see America. I had… saved up some money. But… when I got here, I realized… I could not go back. It was too dangerous.

OFFICER: Ms. Maung, is there anything you would like to add that you think is important for me to know about your case?

APPLICANT: Yes. I… I just want to be safe. I want to live in peace. I have worked hard all my life. I can… contribute to this country. I am a good worker. I am honest. I just… I just want a chance.

OFFICER: What kind of work are you hoping to find here in the United States?

APPLICANT: I am hoping to find work in a restaurant, or maybe in a shop. I have experience with customers. I am a hard worker. I am willing to learn.

OFFICER: Do you have any specific skills that would be valuable in those types of jobs?

APPLICANT: I am good at… talking to people. I am friendly. I can… learn quickly. I am also good at cleaning.

OFFICER: Okay. I have no further questions for you at this time, Ms. Maung. Thank you for your testimony. We will review your application and your interview, and you will be notified of our decision in writing. Do you have any questions for me?

APPLICANT: No, thank you.

OFFICER: Thank you for your time.

INTERVIEW ENDS

OFFICER (Post-Interview Notes):

The applicant, Nyein Maung, presented a case based on fear of persecution due to religious discrimination combined with their non-binary gender identity. While the applicant's English proficiency was adequate, there were moments of hesitation and difficulty in articulating specific details, potentially attributable to trauma or language barriers.

Several aspects of the applicant's testimony require further scrutiny by an Immigration Judge:

*   **Nexus:** The nexus between the applicant's religious belief, gender identity, and the alleged persecution needs further development. While the applicant described instances of verbal harassment and one instance of stone-throwing, the severity and frequency of these incidents, while concerning, may not rise to the level of persecution necessary for asylum. The connection between these incidents and the actions (or inactions) of the Myanmar government also needs clarification.
*   **Credibility:** While the applicant appeared generally credible, their responses regarding their reasons for initially obtaining a visitor visa and then deciding to apply for asylum in the U.S. were somewhat vague. Further questioning regarding their intentions before arriving in the US is warranted.
*   **Country Conditions:** The applicant cited the general political instability in Myanmar as contributing to their fear. While the current situation in Myanmar is well-documented as being volatile, the applicant needs to establish a stronger, individualized nexus between the political climate and their specific fear of persecution.
*   **Internal Relocation:** The applicant’s explanation for not relocating internally within Myanmar was that "it’s the same everywhere." This assertion needs further exploration to determine if internal relocation was a reasonable option, considering the diverse regions and ethnic groups within Myanmar.

Given these complexities and the need for further fact-finding and legal interpretation, this case is being REFERRED to Immigration Court.
