INTERVIEW BEGINS

OFFICER: Good morning, Mr. Lin. My name is Officer Davies, and I am an asylum officer with USCIS. Thank you for coming in today. I want to explain the process. You have applied for asylum, which means you are asking the United States government for protection because you fear persecution in your home country, China. This interview is to determine if you meet the legal requirements for asylum. I will ask you questions about yourself, your family, your life in China, and the reasons why you are afraid to return.

It is very important that you answer all my questions truthfully and completely. You are under oath, meaning that you must tell the truth. Lying to a federal officer is a serious offense. Do you understand?

APPLICANT: Yes, Officer Davies, I understand.

OFFICER: Do you have any questions about the process before we begin?

APPLICANT: No, I think I understand. Thank you.

OFFICER: Please raise your right hand and repeat after me: "I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God."

APPLICANT: I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God.

OFFICER: Thank you. Please be seated. Let's start with some basic information. Can you state your full name for the record?

APPLICANT: Lin, Wei. L-I-N, W-E-I.

OFFICER: And your date of birth?

APPLICANT: March 12, 2003.

OFFICER: And your place of birth?

APPLICANT: A small village near Nanjing, Jiangsu Province.

OFFICER: Your application states you are 21 years old and single, but you have listed one dependent family member on your application. Who is that?

APPLICANT: Yes, that is my younger sister, Lin, Mei. She is still in China. I am hoping to bring her here if my application is approved.

OFFICER: Okay. We'll discuss your sister later. Let's talk about your education. Your application indicates you have completed primary education. Can you tell me about that?

APPLICANT: Yes. In my village, there was a small school. I attended from age six to age twelve. It was very basic. We learned reading, writing, and some mathematics. After that, my family… they couldn't afford for me to go to a proper middle school in the city. I had to work on the farm.

OFFICER: Okay. So you completed six years of primary school. Your application also indicates your profession is in the legal field. Can you explain how you obtained legal skills and knowledge with only a primary education?

APPLICANT: (Hesitates) Yes, that’s… complicated. After working on the farm, I met a man in my village. He was a retired… *legal advisor*, of sorts. He saw that I was… eager to learn. He had a small collection of law books, mostly older ones, and he allowed me to read them. He also taught me about… common law principles, and how to assist people with… basic legal documents. I essentially became an apprentice, although informally.

OFFICER: So, you never attended law school or any formal legal training program?

APPLICANT: No, not formally. It was all through this… apprenticeship.

OFFICER: Did you receive any kind of certification or formal recognition for this apprenticeship?

APPLICANT: No, nothing formal. It was all based on trust and reputation within the village.

OFFICER: I see. Let's move on to the reasons why you left China. You are seeking asylum based on fear of persecution due to gender-based violence. Can you explain what happened to you in China that makes you afraid to return?

APPLICANT: Yes. It started about two years ago. I… I am gay. And in my village, this is… not accepted. It is considered a great shame.

OFFICER: Can you describe specific incidents of harassment or violence you experienced?

APPLICANT: The first time… it was just words. Whispers. People calling me names. "Dirty," "disgusting," "unnatural." Then it escalated. One night, I was walking home from… visiting a friend. A group of men stopped me. They pushed me to the ground. They kicked me. They called me more names. They told me I needed to be "cured."

OFFICER: Can you describe these men? Did you recognize any of them?

APPLICANT: I… I recognized some of them. They were from the village. They were… farmers, like my father.

OFFICER: Do you know their names?

APPLICANT: I… I don't want to say their names. I am still afraid.

OFFICER: I understand. Can you tell me approximately when this incident occurred?

APPLICANT: It was… around June 2022.

OFFICER: And did you report this incident to the police?

APPLICANT: No. I was too afraid. The police in my village… they are not sympathetic to people like me. I heard stories… of them ignoring complaints, or even… participating in the harassment.

OFFICER: Did you seek any medical attention after this assault?

APPLICANT: No. I just… went home. I cleaned myself up. I was too ashamed to tell my family.

OFFICER: You mentioned this was the first incident. Were there other incidents?

APPLICANT: Yes. Many. The harassment continued. People would spit at me in the street. They would throw things at my house. One time, they broke my window. Another time, they… they followed me and threatened me with knives.

OFFICER: Can you provide dates or approximate timeframes for these other incidents?

APPLICANT: The window was broken in… maybe August 2022. The knife incident was… around November 2022.

OFFICER: Did these incidents involve the same men, or were they different people?

APPLICANT: Mostly the same men. But sometimes… others joined in.

OFFICER: Did you ever try to relocate to another part of China where you might feel safer?

APPLICANT: I thought about it. But I had no money. And I was afraid that… even if I moved to a bigger city, I would still face discrimination. And without proper education or skills… I didn’t know how I would survive. Besides, these men knew my family. I was afraid they would retaliate against my parents or my sister if I left.

OFFICER: You mentioned your sister. Is she aware of your sexual orientation?

APPLICANT: No. I never told her. I was too afraid of how she would react.

OFFICER: Why are you unable to return to China now?

APPLICANT: Because… because I am afraid they will kill me. The harassment has gotten worse. And I know that if I go back, they will not stop until I am… gone.

OFFICER: You stated earlier that you worked as a *legal advisor* of sorts. Did you ever use your legal skills to help others who were also being persecuted?

APPLICANT: Yes. I tried. In my village, there were others who were… different. People with disabilities, people who practiced different religions. I tried to help them… write letters, navigate the local bureaucracy. But it was difficult.

OFFICER: Do you have any documents or evidence to support your claims of persecution? Police reports, medical records, witness statements?

APPLICANT: No. I have no police reports, because I never reported anything. I have no medical records, because I never sought medical attention. I have no witness statements, because people are too afraid to speak out. I only have… my word. And some photographs of the damage to my house. I submitted them with my application. (referring to the broken window)

OFFICER: I see those photographs. Thank you. Can you describe your journey to the United States?

APPLICANT: I… I saved up some money. I borrowed some more from friends. I paid a smuggler to help me leave China. I flew to… Ecuador. Then I traveled by land through Central America. It was very difficult. Very dangerous. I arrived at the US border in… December 2023. I asked for asylum at the port of entry.

OFFICER: Do you have any family members in the United States?

APPLICANT: No. No one.

OFFICER: If granted asylum, what are your plans for the future?

APPLICANT: I want to… learn. I want to get an education. I know my primary education is… not much. But I am a hard worker. I am eager to learn. I also want to use my legal skills to help others. Maybe I can become a paralegal, or… something similar. I want to contribute to this country.

OFFICER: You mentioned you assisted people with basic legal documents. Can you give me an example of the types of documents you helped people prepare?

APPLICANT: Yes. Things like… simple contracts, petitions to the local government for assistance, letters of complaint. Very basic things. Nothing complicated.

OFFICER: Given your limited formal education, how confident are you in your ability to succeed in a legal field in the United States, which is a very different legal system from what you are familiar with?

APPLICANT: I know it will be difficult. But I am willing to work hard. I am a fast learner. And I am determined to succeed. I believe that with the right training and support, I can make a positive contribution.

OFFICER: In your asylum application, you indicated that your sister, Lin Mei, is dependent on you. Can you elaborate on the nature of her dependency? Does she rely on you financially, or in other ways?

APPLICANT: Yes, after our parents passed away from illness a few years ago, I became responsible for her well-being. Although she is now 16, I still feel a responsibility to protect her and guide her. I was sending her money from my earnings to help with her school fees and living expenses. I am now unable to do that while here.

OFFICER: And is she currently living with other relatives, or is she living independently?

APPLICANT: She is living with our aunt, my mother's sister. But our aunt is not wealthy, and she has her own family to support. I worry about my sister's future if I am unable to help her.

OFFICER: Mr. Lin, I want to be clear about something. Your application mentions your expertise in legal matters, but you have only completed primary education. This discrepancy raises questions about the validity of your claims. Can you explain this again, in detail?

APPLICANT: (Sighs) I understand your concern. It is true that I did not attend a formal law school. But as I explained earlier, I was fortunate to learn from a retired legal advisor in my village. He taught me a great deal about the law, and I spent countless hours reading and studying on my own. While I may not have a formal degree, I possess a practical understanding of legal principles.

OFFICER: But without formal credentials, how can you be sure that your knowledge is accurate and up-to-date? Legal matters can be complex and require specialized training.

APPLICANT: I understand that. That is why I am committed to continuing my education if I am granted asylum. I want to obtain the necessary qualifications to practice law in the United States. I am willing to start from the beginning and work my way up.

OFFICER: Okay, Mr. Lin. I have no further questions for you at this time. Do you have anything else you would like to add?

APPLICANT: Yes. I just want to say that I am telling the truth. I am genuinely afraid to return to China. I believe that my life is in danger. I am asking for your help.

OFFICER: Thank you, Mr. Lin. I will review your application and the information you have provided today. You will receive a written decision in the mail.
