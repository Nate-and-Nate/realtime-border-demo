INTERVIEW BEGINS

OFFICER: Good morning. My name is Officer Thompson, and I am an asylum officer with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Today, we are conducting an interview regarding your application for asylum in the United States. Before we begin, I need to explain the process. This interview is conducted under oath, meaning you must tell the truth. Everything you say will be recorded. After the interview, I will review the information you provide and make a recommendation on your case. My recommendation will then be reviewed by a supervisory officer. It is possible that your case will be approved, denied, or referred to an immigration judge for further review in immigration court. Do you understand?

APPLICANT: Yes, I understand.

OFFICER: Please raise your right hand and repeat after me: “I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God.”

APPLICANT: I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God.

OFFICER: Thank you. Please state your full name and date of birth for the record.

APPLICANT: My name is Li Mei, and my date of birth is October 15, 1999.

OFFICER: Thank you. And you currently reside at the address you provided on your I-589 application, is that correct?

APPLICANT: Yes, that is correct.

OFFICER: Okay, Li Mei, let’s start with some background information. Where were you born and raised?

APPLICANT: I was born and raised in Chengdu, in the Sichuan province of China.

OFFICER: And how long did you live there?

APPLICANT: I lived there my whole life, until I came to the United States. So, 24 years.

OFFICER: Can you describe your family situation growing up?

APPLICANT: I lived with my parents. My father, Li Wei, he was an engineer. My mother, Zhang Lan, she worked at a… a small clothing shop. I am an only child.

OFFICER: What is your gender identity?

APPLICANT: I identify as non-binary.

OFFICER: Did you identify as non-binary while living in China?

APPLICANT: Yes, but… it was very difficult. I tried to express myself, but it was… suppressed. I mostly kept it to myself.

OFFICER: We will discuss that later. Now, let’s talk about your education. What is the highest level of education you have completed?

APPLICANT: I finished secondary school. High school, basically.

OFFICER: Did you obtain any certifications or diplomas upon completing secondary school?

APPLICANT: Yes, I received a diploma. The standard high school diploma.

OFFICER: And after secondary school, what did you do?

APPLICANT: I… I studied to become a nurse’s assistant. It was a vocational program, about two years.

OFFICER: Where did you complete this vocational program?

APPLICANT: At the Chengdu Vocational Training Center.

OFFICER: And did you receive any certification or license after completing the program?

APPLICANT: Yes, I received a certificate allowing me to work as a nurse’s assistant.

OFFICER: Can you describe your work experience after completing your training?

APPLICANT: I worked at a small, private clinic in Chengdu. It was… a general practice clinic. I helped the nurses and doctors. I took patient vital signs, assisted with basic medical procedures, and helped with administrative tasks.

OFFICER: How long did you work at this clinic?

APPLICANT: For about three years.

OFFICER: Why did you leave that job?

APPLICANT: Because of… problems. Because of my political opinions and… because of who I am.

OFFICER: Let’s talk about that. Your application states that you fear persecution in China based on your political opinion. Can you explain what those political opinions are?

APPLICANT: I… I believe in freedom of expression. I believe in democracy. I believe the government should be accountable to the people. These are not… popular opinions in China.

OFFICER: How did you express these opinions in China?

APPLICANT: At first, it was just online. I would post on social media, using VPNs to bypass the censorship. I would criticize the government’s policies. I would support human rights activists.

OFFICER: Can you provide specific examples of what you posted online?

APPLICANT: Yes. I… I criticized the government's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. I posted about the lack of transparency and the suppression of information. I also… I also posted about the Uyghur situation in Xinjiang. I shared articles and information about the human rights abuses there. I also posted about the Hong Kong protests.

OFFICER: Did you use your real name when posting these comments?

APPLICANT: No, no. I used a pseudonym. But… but I think they figured out who I was.

OFFICER: How do you think they figured out who you were?

APPLICANT: Because… because of what happened at work. And… and the police questioning.

OFFICER: Tell me about what happened at work.

APPLICANT: One day, my supervisor called me into his office. He… he said that he had seen my online posts. He said that they were… “unacceptable” and “anti-government.” He said that I was… “disrupting social harmony.” He warned me to stop. He said that if I didn’t, he would have to report me to the authorities.

OFFICER: Did you stop posting after that warning?

APPLICANT: No. I was scared, but I couldn’t… I couldn’t stay silent. I believed in what I was saying. I just… I became more careful. I used stronger VPNs. I tried to hide my identity better.

OFFICER: And what happened after that?

APPLICANT: A few weeks later, the police came to my apartment. It was late at night. They… they searched my apartment. They took my computer and my phone. They questioned me for hours.

OFFICER: What did they ask you during the questioning?

APPLICANT: They asked me about my online activities. They asked me about my political views. They asked me if I was involved in any… “subversive” activities. They accused me of spreading rumors and inciting unrest.

OFFICER: Did they physically harm you during the questioning?

APPLICANT: No, not physically. But… they were very intimidating. They threatened me. They said that if I didn’t cooperate, they would… they would make things very difficult for me and my family.

OFFICER: Did they arrest you?

APPLICANT: No, they let me go. But they told me to report to the police station every week for… “re-education.”

OFFICER: What did this “re-education” entail?

APPLICANT: It was… propaganda. They would show us videos and give us lectures about the… the greatness of the Communist Party and the importance of following the government’s policies. They would try to… to brainwash us.

OFFICER: How long did you have to attend these sessions?

APPLICANT: For about a month. I stopped going after that.

OFFICER: Why did you stop going?

APPLICANT: Because I was scared. I knew that if I kept going, they would… they would eventually arrest me. I knew that I had to leave the country.

OFFICER: Did you report this incident to anyone? Any human rights organizations or lawyers?

APPLICANT: No. I was too afraid. I didn’t trust anyone.

OFFICER: Did you consider moving to another part of China to avoid these problems?

APPLICANT: Yes, I did. But… but I knew that it wouldn’t be safe anywhere in China. The government’s reach is everywhere. They can find you no matter where you go.

OFFICER: Why do you believe that?

APPLICANT: Because of what I saw happening to other people. People who had spoken out against the government… they disappeared. They were arrested. They were… silenced. I knew that if I stayed in China, the same thing would happen to me.

OFFICER: What evidence do you have to support your claims? Have you submitted any supporting documents?

APPLICANT: Yes, I have submitted some… some screenshots of my social media posts. I also have… I have a copy of the warning letter that my supervisor gave me. And… and I have a letter from a friend who… who witnessed some of the police harassment. I also submitted articles about the human rights situation in China.

OFFICER: Let’s talk about your family. Are your parents aware of your political opinions and your activities?

APPLICANT: They… they knew that I was unhappy with the government. But they didn’t know the extent of my involvement. I didn’t want to put them in danger.

OFFICER: Are they at risk now because of your actions?

APPLICANT: I… I worry about them. I haven’t been able to contact them since I left China. I’m afraid that the police are watching them.

OFFICER: When did you leave China, and how did you travel to the United States?

APPLICANT: I left China on… on July 10th, 2024. I flew to… to Mexico City. And then I traveled to the United States by land.

OFFICER: How did you enter the United States?

APPLICANT: I crossed the border… near Tijuana.

OFFICER: Did you have a valid visa to enter the United States?

APPLICANT: No.

OFFICER: What are your plans if you are granted asylum in the United States?

APPLICANT: I want to… I want to continue working in healthcare. I want to get my… my nursing assistant certification recognized here. I want to… I want to contribute to society. I want to live in freedom.

OFFICER: Are you familiar with the requirements for maintaining asylum status and eventually applying for permanent residency?

APPLICANT: Yes, I have been researching them. I understand that I need to abide by U.S. laws and maintain a clean record.

OFFICER: Do you have any questions for me at this time?

APPLICANT: Yes. What… what happens now?

OFFICER: I will review the information you have provided, along with any supporting documents you have submitted. I will then make a recommendation on your case. You will receive a written notice in the mail regarding the decision on your case. It could be an approval, a denial, or a referral to immigration court.

APPLICANT: Okay. Thank you.

OFFICER: Ms. Li, you indicated that you have a letter from a friend who witnessed some of the police harassment. Could you please describe the harassment your friend witnessed?

APPLICANT: Yes. One time, when I was walking home from work, two plainclothes police officers stopped me. They asked me for my ID. They started asking me questions about my online activities, right there on the street. It was very public and humiliating. My friend, she happened to be walking by and saw what was happening. She pretended not to know me, but she saw the whole thing. She wrote a letter describing what she saw.

OFFICER: The letter you submitted is quite vague. It only mentions "an unpleasant encounter" with "some individuals." Why isn't it more specific, given that your friend witnessed police harassment?

APPLICANT: My friend… she is still in China. She was afraid to write too much detail, because she didn’t want to get into trouble with the police herself. She wanted to help me, but she also had to protect herself.

OFFICER: I understand. You also mentioned that you stopped attending the "re-education" sessions after a month. Can you explain why you waited a month before stopping, given your fear of arrest?

APPLICANT: I… I was hoping that things would get better. I was hoping that the police would… would forget about me. I was also afraid of what would happen if I didn’t go. I thought that if I just cooperated, they would eventually leave me alone. But… but it didn’t work. The pressure just kept increasing.

OFFICER: Ms. Li, your case presents some complexities. While you have articulated a fear of persecution based on your political opinions and your non-binary identity, the evidence you have submitted is somewhat limited. The letter from your friend lacks specific details, and your social media posts, while critical of the government, may not rise to the level of persecution. Furthermore, the fact that the police did not arrest you initially, but only required you to attend re-education sessions, could be interpreted as something less than persecution. However, the totality of the circumstances, including the threats you received, the police harassment, and your well-founded fear of future persecution, warrants further review by an immigration judge.

OFFICER: Do you have anything else you would like to add?

APPLICANT: I… I just want to say that I am telling the truth. I am really afraid to go back to China. I know that if I go back, I will be in danger.

OFFICER: Thank you, Ms. Li. That concludes our interview. You will receive a notice in the mail regarding the decision on your case.
