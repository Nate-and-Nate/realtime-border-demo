INTERVIEW BEGINS

OFFICER: Good morning, Ms. Rodriguez. My name is Officer Miller, and this is an interview to determine your eligibility for asylum in the United States. I am here to ask you questions about your background and the reasons why you left Venezuela. Before we begin, I need to swear you in. Please raise your right hand and repeat after me: Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

APPLICANT: I do.

OFFICER: Thank you. And good morning, Ms. Chen. Please state your name for the record.

ATTORNEY: Sarah Chen, representing Ms. Rodriguez.

OFFICER: Thank you. Ms. Rodriguez, you have submitted an application for asylum, and I've reviewed it. However, I need to ask you questions to clarify some points and gather more information. Please feel free to take your time and answer as honestly as possible. Let's start with some background information. Could you please state your full name and date of birth for the record?

APPLICANT: My full name is Isabella Rodriguez, and my date of birth is March 12, 1968.

OFFICER: Thank you. Your application states that you are from Venezuela. Can you tell me about the city or town where you lived?

APPLICANT: I lived in Caracas, the capital.

OFFICER: And what was your profession in Venezuela?

APPLICANT: I worked in construction. I… I was a contractor, mostly.

OFFICER: Your application also mentions that you have a doctoral degree. What subject is your doctorate in?

APPLICANT: (Hesitates) It’s in… Religious Studies.

OFFICER: Religious Studies? And how did you balance working as a construction contractor with holding a doctoral degree in Religious Studies?

APPLICANT: Well, you see, I obtained my doctorate many years ago, before the… the situation in Venezuela became so difficult. I used to teach at the university part-time while also doing construction work. The construction was more reliable for income, especially after my father passed away and I needed to support my mother.

OFFICER: I see. So, you were a professor and a contractor. Can you elaborate on your religious beliefs and how they have made you a target of persecution in Venezuela?

APPLICANT: I am a… a devotee of Santeria. It’s a… a syncretic religion, a mix of West African beliefs and Catholicism. It’s… looked down upon by some.

OFFICER: Can you describe the specific actions or statements you made that led to you being targeted?

APPLICANT: (Long pause) It wasn’t really… specific actions. It was more… the fact that I practiced Santeria openly. I had… altars in my home. And people knew. I… I would participate in ceremonies.

OFFICER: Your application mentions threats and harassment. Can you provide specific examples, including dates, locations, and the individuals involved?

APPLICANT: (Fidgets) It started with… neighbors making comments. Saying I was practicing witchcraft. Then… one day, I found my car vandalized. It had… symbols painted on it. I don’t know who did it. This was maybe… two years ago? 2022, perhaps.

OFFICER: You don't know exactly when it happened?

APPLICANT: Not the exact date, no. I didn't report it to the police. What would they do? They don't care about things like that.

OFFICER: Did the vandalism happen more than once?

APPLICANT: Yes, a few times. And… once, someone threw rocks at my house.

OFFICER: When did that happen?

APPLICANT: It was… maybe six months after the car incident.

OFFICER: Ms. Rodriguez, your application states that you were directly threatened with physical harm. Can you describe this incident in detail?

APPLICANT: (Looks down) Yes. One night, I was coming home from a ceremony. It was late. A group of men… they stopped me. They yelled at me. Called me names. Said I was a devil worshipper. They… they pushed me.

OFFICER: Did they physically harm you beyond pushing?

APPLICANT: No… not really. They just… pushed me and yelled.

OFFICER: Did you recognize any of these men?

APPLICANT: No, I didn't. It was dark.

OFFICER: Did you report this incident to the police?

APPLICANT: No. I was too scared. And I didn’t trust them.

OFFICER: Why didn't you trust them?

APPLICANT: Because… they are corrupt. They often side with the people in power, and the people in power… they don’t like Santeria.

OFFICER: Did you seek protection from any other authorities or organizations?

APPLICANT: No. There was no one to turn to.

OFFICER: Did you consider moving to another part of Venezuela where you might be safer?

APPLICANT: I did, but… I had my mother to care for. And… I didn’t have the money to just pick up and move. Besides, these people… they have connections everywhere. I was afraid they would find me.

OFFICER: Your application mentions that you feared for your life. But you also said the men only pushed you. Can you explain why you felt your life was in danger?

APPLICANT: It was… the feeling. The way they looked at me. The hatred in their eyes. I knew they were capable of anything. And… I heard stories. Other people who practiced Santeria… they disappeared.

OFFICER: Do you have any evidence to support these stories?

APPLICANT: No… just rumors. Word of mouth.

OFFICER: Ms. Rodriguez, let's talk about your travel to the United States. When did you arrive, and how did you enter the country?

APPLICANT: I arrived on… June 15th, 2023. I came on a tourist visa.

OFFICER: You obtained a tourist visa. What did you tell the consular officer during your visa interview regarding your plans for visiting the United States?

APPLICANT: I told them I was coming for a vacation. To visit some friends.

OFFICER: You didn’t mention any intention of seeking asylum?

APPLICANT: No. I was afraid they wouldn’t give me the visa if I did.

OFFICER: So, you misrepresented your intentions to obtain the visa?

APPLICANT: (Looks at her attorney) I… I didn’t want to lie, but I felt I had no choice.

OFFICER: Ms. Chen, do you have anything you'd like to add at this point?

ATTORNEY: Officer Miller, my client acted out of a genuine fear for her safety. She believed that disclosing her true intentions would jeopardize her chances of escaping persecution.

OFFICER: I understand. Ms. Rodriguez, what are your plans if you are granted asylum in the United States?

APPLICANT: I want to… rebuild my life. I want to find work. Maybe I can… use my construction skills to help people.

OFFICER: Your application states you have experience in large-scale commercial construction projects. Can you tell me about some of these projects?

APPLICANT: (Hesitates) I… I worked on… many buildings. Apartment buildings, mostly.

OFFICER: Can you name a specific project you worked on and describe your role?

APPLICANT: (Long pause) It was… a long time ago. I don’t remember the names of the projects. I was just… a contractor. Supervising the workers.

OFFICER: But you have a doctorate. Why were you working as a contractor?

APPLICANT: As I said, it was more reliable income. The university… they didn’t pay well.

OFFICER: So your doctoral degree in Religious Studies didn't translate into more lucrative opportunities than being a construction contractor?

APPLICANT: (Sighs) No, not really. Not in Venezuela.

OFFICER: Do you have any documents to support your claims of religious persecution, such as police reports, medical records, or photographs?

APPLICANT: I have… some photos of the vandalism on my car. And… a letter from a friend who also practices Santeria, describing the difficulties they face. I submitted them with my application.

OFFICER: I see them. The photos are blurry and don't clearly show the symbols you described. And the letter from your friend is a personal account, not an official document. Ms. Rodriguez, is there anything else you would like to add before we conclude this interview?

APPLICANT: I just… I just want to be safe. I can't go back to Venezuela. They will hurt me. Maybe even kill me.

OFFICER: Thank you, Ms. Rodriguez. I appreciate your honesty. Ms. Chen, do you have any final comments?

ATTORNEY: No, Officer Miller. Thank you for your time.

OFFICER: Ms. Rodriguez, this interview is now concluded. We will review your application and the information you provided today. You will receive a written decision in the mail.
