INTERVIEW BEGINS

OFFICER: Good morning, Ms. Dubois. My name is Officer Miller, and I’m an asylum officer with USCIS. Thank you for coming in today. As you know, you’ve applied for asylum in the United States. This interview is a crucial part of the process. I need to understand your reasons for seeking asylum. I will ask you questions about your background, your experiences in Haiti, and your reasons for leaving. Please answer all my questions truthfully and to the best of your ability. Do you understand?

APPLICANT: Yes, I understand.

OFFICER: Before we begin, I need to swear you in. Please raise your right hand. Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

APPLICANT: I do.

OFFICER: Thank you. Let’s start with some basic information. Can you please state your full name and date of birth for the record?

APPLICANT: My name is Marie Dubois, and my birthday is October 15, 1974.

OFFICER: Thank you. And can you confirm the spelling of your last name?

APPLICANT: D-U-B-O-I-S.

OFFICER: Alright. You indicated on your application that you are seeking asylum based on a fear of persecution due to your race. Can you explain to me why you fear persecution in Haiti based on your race?

APPLICANT: Yes. In Haiti… it is complicated. I am… lighter skinned. My mother, she was… how you say… mixed. And my father, darker. But people, they see me and they think I am… different. Better. But they also resent. They think I have advantages I don't.

OFFICER: Can you give me specific examples of how this perceived difference led to persecution? What happened to you, specifically?

APPLICANT: Well… from when I was a child, the other children, they would call me names. “Blanc,” they would say. “Whitey.” And… they would not play with me. It was mostly verbal, you understand? But… it hurt.

OFFICER: I understand. And this continued into adulthood?

APPLICANT: Yes. When I started working… in construction… it was worse. The men, they would… they would not respect me. They would say… inappropriate things. And they would try to… take advantage.

OFFICER: Can you provide specific details of these incidents? Dates, locations, what was said, who was involved?

APPLICANT: It was… many times. Hard to remember each one. But… there was this one time… about five years ago… maybe 2018? We were building a house in Port-au-Prince, near Carrefour. And this man, Jean… he was the foreman. He kept… touching me. On my arm, my back. And he would say things… about my skin. How soft it was. How different. I told him to stop, but he wouldn't.

OFFICER: Did you report this to anyone?

APPLICANT: No. Who would I tell? He was the foreman. The one in charge. And… the other men, they would laugh. They would say I was being too sensitive.

OFFICER: You mentioned working in construction. What type of work did you do specifically? Did you have any formal training?

APPLICANT: I… I learned from my father. He was a builder. I helped him since I was young. I can… I can do many things. Mixing cement, laying bricks… some carpentry. No formal training, just… experience. I went to primary school, but only for a few years. I had to work to help support my family.

OFFICER: Okay. Going back to the issue of persecution, can you tell me about any instances of physical violence you experienced due to your race?

APPLICANT: No… no direct violence. But… the feeling… the threat… it was always there. You see?

OFFICER: So, no one ever physically harmed you because of your race?

APPLICANT: Not… directly. But… once… there was a… a protest. About… about the government. But it turned… ugly. People were shouting… angry things. And someone… threw a rock. It hit me… on the arm. I don’t know if it was… because of my skin. But… I felt like it was.

OFFICER: Do you have any police reports or medical records related to this incident or any other incidents you’ve described?

APPLICANT: No. I didn’t go to the police. What would they do? And… the rock… it was just a bruise. I didn't see a doctor.

OFFICER: Did you ever consider moving to another part of Haiti where you might feel safer?

APPLICANT: Yes. We… we thought about it. But… my family… my husband, my children… their jobs, their school… it was too difficult to just… leave. And where would we go? The same problems are everywhere, you know?

OFFICER: You mentioned your husband and children. Are they also lighter skinned? Do they experience the same treatment?

APPLICANT: My husband… he is darker than me. The children… some are lighter, some are darker. They… they haven't had the same problems. But… I worry about them. Especially my daughters.

OFFICER: In your application, you stated you fear returning to Haiti. What specific events led to your decision to leave Haiti and seek asylum here in the United States?

APPLICANT: It was… the feeling. The constant fear. And… the political situation. It was getting worse and worse. The gangs… they were taking over. And… I heard stories… of people being… hurt. Because of their race. I thought… I had to protect my family.

OFFICER: Can you tell me about these stories? Specific examples?

APPLICANT: It was… on the radio. And… from neighbors. They said that… the gangs, they were targeting… light-skinned people. Because they thought they had money. Because they thought they were… connected to the government.

OFFICER: Do you have any evidence to support these claims? News articles, reports from human rights organizations?

APPLICANT: No… just… what I heard. Everyone was talking about it.

OFFICER: How did you travel to the United States? Can you describe your route and your means of entry?

APPLICANT: We… we flew to… to Mexico. And then… we crossed the border. Illegally.

OFFICER: Who helped you with this journey?

APPLICANT: We… we had help. From… from people. I don't know their names. They… they just helped us get across the border.

OFFICER: You're being vague. Can you provide more details about these individuals? Did you pay them? How did you find them?

APPLICANT: Yes, we paid them. But… I don’t want to say too much. They… they could get into trouble. We found them… through friends.

OFFICER: Ms. Dubois, it's important that you're forthcoming with all the details. Withholding information can affect your case.

APPLICANT: I… I understand. It was just… difficult. They… they weren’t nice people. They demanded more money than we agreed. And they… threatened us.

OFFICER: What kind of threats?

APPLICANT: They said… they would leave us in the desert. With no food or water. If we didn’t pay.

OFFICER: Okay. Let's talk about your plans if you are granted asylum here in the United States. You mentioned your experience in construction. Do you plan to continue working in that field?

APPLICANT: Yes. That is what I know. That is how I can support my family. I am a hard worker. I am willing to learn.

OFFICER: Have you looked into what kind of certifications or licenses you might need to work in construction here?

APPLICANT: Not yet. I… I was hoping… that if I get asylum… I can start to look into that.

OFFICER: Ms. Dubois, you mentioned you have five family members who are depending on you. Can you provide their names, dates of birth, and relationship to you?

APPLICANT: Yes. There is my husband, Jean-Pierre Dubois, born March 12, 1972. Then my children: Sophie, born July 20, 2000; Pierre, born November 5, 2003; Isabelle, born January 10, 2006; and Jacques, born April 18, 2008.

OFFICER: Are they all currently in the United States with you?

APPLICANT: Yes, they are all here.

OFFICER: Have they also experienced persecution in Haiti?

APPLICANT: Not… not like me. But… they have seen what I have gone through. They are afraid for me. And… they are afraid for themselves.

OFFICER: Ms. Dubois, I have a few more questions. You mentioned the gangs in Haiti. Did you ever consider seeking protection from the police or other authorities?

APPLICANT: The police? They are… useless. They are either corrupt or… they are afraid of the gangs themselves. They would not help me.

OFFICER: Did you ever report any of the incidents you described to the police?

APPLICANT: No.

OFFICER: Why not?

APPLICANT: Because… it would be a waste of time. And… it could make things worse.

OFFICER: One last question. You stated you only completed primary school. How did you learn to speak English so fluently?

APPLICANT: I… I learned from… from television. And… from talking to people. I am a good listener.

OFFICER: Thank you, Ms. Dubois. I have no further questions at this time. Do you have anything else you would like to add?

APPLICANT: No… I think I have said everything. Thank you for listening.

OFFICER: Thank you for your time. We will notify you of our decision in writing.
