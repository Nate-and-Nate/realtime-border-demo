OFFICER: Alright. So, Mr. Li, we will be discussing the reasons you are seeking asylum in the United States. Please answer my questions as completely and honestly as possible. Let’s start with some background information. Can you tell me about your life in China before you came to the United States?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I lived in Beijing my whole life. I studied at [Name of Beijing University, consistent with healthcare field] and earned a Bachelor's degree in Nursing. After graduating, I worked as a registered nurse at [Name of Beijing Hospital, reasonable size and specialty].

OFFICER: And can you describe your family situation in China?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) My parents are deceased. My mother died when I was young, and my father passed away five years ago. I have one younger brother, but we are not close. He does not understand me.

OFFICER: What do you mean by "he does not understand you?"

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) He… he does not accept my… my true self. I am… non-binary. He believes it is… a Western sickness.

OFFICER: Okay. Thank you for sharing that. Now, you mentioned working as a registered nurse. Can you describe your responsibilities in that role?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I cared for patients in the [Specialty consistent with nursing background, e.g., cardiology] department. I administered medication, monitored vital signs, assisted doctors with procedures, and provided emotional support to patients and their families. I was a good nurse. I cared deeply for my patients.

OFFICER: We'll come back to your gender identity later. Now, why did you leave China and come to the United States?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I left because I fear for my safety in China. I am afraid of the government and… and others who do not agree with my political views.

OFFICER: What political views are you referring to?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I believe in democracy and freedom of speech. I believe everyone should have the right to express their opinions without fear of punishment. I also believe in LGBTQ+ rights.

OFFICER: Can you tell me about specific incidents that led you to fear persecution?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) It started with online discussions. I used to participate in online forums where we discussed politics and social issues. I often criticized the government’s censorship and its treatment of minorities, including LGBTQ+ people.

OFFICER: Can you give me an example of what you wrote or said online?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I wrote about the need for free elections and the importance of protecting human rights. I also criticized the government's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. I said they were hiding the truth.

OFFICER: And what happened as a result of these online postings?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) At first, nothing. But then, I started receiving threatening messages online. People called me names, accused me of being a traitor, and said I would be punished for my views. They found my personal information and posted it online - my address, my workplace.

OFFICER: Did you report these threats to the police?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) No. I did not trust the police. They are part of the government. Reporting would only make things worse.

OFFICER: What happened next?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Then, one evening, I was walking home from work, and two men stopped me. They knew my name. They said I should stop spreading “rumors” about the government. They pushed me against a wall and… and hit me.

OFFICER: Can you describe these men?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) (Through interpreter) They were… average height, wearing dark clothes. I couldn’t see their faces clearly. It was dark.

OFFICER: When did this happen? Please provide the date, or the approximate date.

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) This was… April 15, 2022.

OFFICER: Where did this happen?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) On [Street Name] near my apartment in Beijing.

OFFICER: Did you seek medical attention after this assault?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) No. I was afraid to go to the hospital. I thought they might report me to the police.

OFFICER: Did anything else happen?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes. After that, I noticed I was being followed. People would stand outside my apartment building, watching me. I felt like I was being watched everywhere I went. Then, one day, my supervisor at the hospital called me into her office. She said she had received complaints about my online activity. She said I was creating trouble for the hospital and that I needed to be careful. She implied that I could lose my job.

OFFICER: Did you lose your job?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Not directly. But the pressure was unbearable. I felt like I was living in constant fear. I knew I had to leave China to protect myself.

OFFICER: Did you try to move to another part of China to avoid this persecution?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) No. I did not think it would help. The government's reach is everywhere. They can find you anywhere in China. And my brother… he lives in [Province in China]. I could not go to him.

OFFICER: Why not?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Because of my… my gender identity. He does not accept me. He would not help me.

OFFICER: How did you eventually leave China?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I obtained a tourist visa to the United States. I saved money from my job at the hospital. I told my supervisor I was going on vacation.

OFFICER: When did you arrive in the United States?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) June 20, 2022.

OFFICER: What airport did you arrive at?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) [Name of Airport].

OFFICER: And have you overstayed your visa?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes. I applied for asylum because I cannot return to China.

OFFICER: What do you fear will happen to you if you return to China?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I fear that I will be arrested and imprisoned for my political views and my gender identity. I fear that I will be tortured or killed. I know that the government monitors online activity and punishes those who criticize them. And as a non-binary person, I would face discrimination and harassment.

OFFICER: Have you ever been arrested or detained in China?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) No. But the fear of arrest is always there.

OFFICER: Do you have any evidence to support your claims, such as copies of your online posts or medical records related to the assault?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I have screenshots of some of my online posts and the threatening messages I received. I also have a letter from a friend in China who can testify to the fact that I was being monitored. I have submitted these with my application.

OFFICER: We have those documents. Thank you. Do you have any family members in the United States?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) No. I am alone here.

OFFICER: Are your family members in China aware of your asylum application?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) My brother knows I am in the United States, but he does not know I have applied for asylum. I do not want him to be targeted because of me.

OFFICER: If granted asylum, what are your plans for the future?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I want to work as a nurse again. I have been researching the requirements for foreign-trained nurses in the United States. I am willing to take any necessary courses or exams to become certified. I want to contribute to society and help people. I also want to be able to live openly and honestly as my true self, without fear of persecution.

OFFICER: Do you have any skills besides nursing?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I am fluent in Mandarin Chinese. I am also a quick learner. I am determined to succeed in the United States.

OFFICER: How would you describe your Mandarin Chinese? Are there any dialects?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I speak standard Mandarin, the Beijing dialect.

OFFICER: Are you currently taking any English classes?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes, I am attending English classes at [Name of Local Community College or Organization] three times a week. It is difficult, but I am trying my best.

OFFICER: Have you ever been a member of any political organizations, either in China or elsewhere?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) No.

OFFICER: Have you ever been associated with any group that has used or advocated violence?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) No, never.

OFFICER: Are you aware of any reason why you would not be eligible for asylum in the United States?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) No.

OFFICER: Mr. Li, I am going to ask you a few questions about your gender identity. You stated that you are non-binary. Can you explain what that means to you?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) It means that I do not identify as male or female. I feel like I am somewhere in between. I have always felt this way, even as a child.

OFFICER: How does this manifest in your daily life? Do you present yourself in a particular way?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) In China, it was very difficult to express myself. I had to conform to societal expectations. But here, in the United States, I feel more free. I dress in a way that feels comfortable to me. Sometimes I wear traditionally masculine clothing, sometimes traditionally feminine clothing, and sometimes a mix of both.

OFFICER: Have you undergone any medical treatments or procedures related to your gender identity?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) No. I have not had any surgeries or hormone therapy.

OFFICER: Do you intend to pursue any medical treatments related to your gender identity in the future?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I… I am considering it. But I have not made any decisions yet. My priority is to learn English and find a job.

OFFICER: I see in your application that you submitted several articles about the human rights situation in China. Can you tell me which article you feel is most relevant to your case?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) The article about the government's censorship of the internet is very important. It shows how they control information and punish those who speak out against them. Also, the article about the discrimination faced by LGBTQ+ people in China. It explains how difficult it is to live openly and honestly.

OFFICER: I’m going to go back to something you said earlier. You mentioned that you were followed after the assault. Can you describe the people who were following you? Were they the same men who assaulted you?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I… I don’t know if they were the same men. I couldn't see their faces clearly. They were always in the distance. But I felt like I was being watched. I could feel their eyes on me.

OFFICER: Did you ever see them in a specific type of vehicle? Did you ever see them speak to anyone else?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) No. I only saw them on foot. They never spoke to anyone. They were just… there. Always watching.

OFFICER: Mr. Li, is there anything else you would like to add that you think is important for me to know in considering your asylum application?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I just want to say that I am a good person. I am not a criminal. I just want to live in peace and freedom. I am afraid to return to China. I believe that if I return, I will be persecuted for my political views and my gender identity. I am asking for your help.

OFFICER: Thank you, Mr. Li. I have no further questions for you at this time. We will notify you of our decision in writing. Please ensure that you keep your address updated with USCIS.

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Thank you.
