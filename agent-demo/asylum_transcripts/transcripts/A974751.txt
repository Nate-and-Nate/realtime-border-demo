INTERVIEW BEGINS

OFFICER: Good morning, Ms. Rodriguez. My name is Officer Miller, and this is an interview to determine your eligibility for asylum in the United States. With me is your attorney, [Attorney's Name]. I need to inform you that I am recording this interview. Is that acceptable to you?

APPLICANT: Yes, Officer. Good morning.

OFFICER: Thank you. Before we begin, I need to swear you in. Please raise your right hand and repeat after me: Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

APPLICANT: I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God.

OFFICER: Thank you. Please be seated. Now, Ms. Rodriguez, let’s start with some background information. Can you please state your full name and date of birth for the record?

APPLICANT: My full name is Maria Elena Rodriguez Garcia, and my date of birth is October 12, 1978.

OFFICER: And where were you born?

APPLICANT: Managua, Nicaragua.

OFFICER: And you are currently residing at the address you provided on your application, is that correct?

APPLICANT: Yes, that is correct.

OFFICER: Okay. Ms. Rodriguez, you are seeking asylum in the United States based on a fear of persecution in Nicaragua. Can you tell me why you are afraid to return?

APPLICANT: Yes. I am afraid because of my religion. I am Evangelical Christian, and the government… they don’t like the Evangelicals.

OFFICER: Can you elaborate on that? What specifically has the government done, or what do you fear they will do, because of your religious beliefs?

APPLICANT: Well, they… they watch us. At church. And they harass the pastor. They say he is… a counter-revolutionary. And they make it hard for us to have services.

OFFICER: When did this start happening?

APPLICANT: Uh… maybe… two years ago? Yes, about two years. After the protests.

OFFICER: The protests in 2018?

APPLICANT: Yes, that’s right.

OFFICER: Okay. Let’s go back a bit. Can you describe your life in Nicaragua before these problems started? What did you do for work?

APPLICANT: I worked in a restaurant. As a waitress. For many years. Since I finished school.

OFFICER: What level of education did you complete?

APPLICANT: Secondary school. I finished. But no university. We didn’t have the money.

OFFICER: So, you completed all years of secondary school? Did you receive a diploma?

APPLICANT: Yes, I finished. I have… I think I have a copy of the diploma with my papers. I think I gave it to my lawyer. [Looks at her attorney]

ATTORNEY: We included a copy of what Ms. Rodriguez believes is her diploma, Officer, but it's rather faded and difficult to read. We are attempting to obtain a certified copy from Nicaragua, but it has been challenging.

OFFICER: Okay. Ms. Rodriguez, can you tell me more about your work as a waitress? What were your responsibilities?

APPLICANT: Taking orders. Bringing food. Cleaning tables. You know… waitress things. I worked at a small restaurant near my house. It was… okay.

OFFICER: How long did you work there?

APPLICANT: Uh… maybe… ten years? Yes, about ten years.

OFFICER: And why did you leave that job?

APPLICANT: Because… because the restaurant closed. The owner… he had problems.

OFFICER: What kind of problems?

APPLICANT: He… he owed money. And he had to close.

OFFICER: Did you find another job after that?

APPLICANT: Yes. I worked at another restaurant. But it was not so good. The pay was less.

OFFICER: How long did you work at the second restaurant?

APPLICANT: Only… maybe six months.

OFFICER: Why did you leave that job?

APPLICANT: Because… because the problems with the church got worse. I needed to… to be at church more. To support my pastor.

OFFICER: Can you give me a specific example of the harassment your pastor faced?

APPLICANT: Yes. One time… the police… they came to the church during the service. They said we were… having a meeting without permission. But we were just… praying. They took the pastor outside and… and yelled at him. They said he was… spreading lies.

OFFICER: Do you know the names of these police officers?

APPLICANT: No. I… I was too scared to look.

OFFICER: Can you describe them?

APPLICANT: They were… young. Wearing uniforms. With guns.

OFFICER: Did they physically harm the pastor?

APPLICANT: No. Not… not that time. But they threatened him. They said… they said they were watching him.

OFFICER: Did you report this incident to anyone?

APPLICANT: No. Who would I report it to? The police? They were the ones doing it!

OFFICER: Did this happen more than once?

APPLICANT: Yes. Many times. Not always the police. Sometimes… men in plain clothes. But we knew… they were with the government.

OFFICER: What did these men in plain clothes do?

APPLICANT: They would… stand outside the church. Taking pictures. And they would… follow us after the service.

OFFICER: Did they ever speak to you directly?

APPLICANT: One time… one of them… he stopped me on the street. He said… “Be careful what you say at church, Maria. We are watching you.”

OFFICER: When did this happen?

APPLICANT: Uh… maybe… six months before I left.

OFFICER: And this is the only time someone directly threatened you?

APPLICANT: Yes. The only time directly. But… we all felt threatened.

OFFICER: Did you ever consider moving to another part of Nicaragua to avoid this harassment?

APPLICANT: No. My family is all in Managua. And… the government is everywhere. It would not have helped.

OFFICER: Did you seek help from any human rights organizations in Nicaragua?

APPLICANT: No. I didn’t know… I didn’t know who to trust.

OFFICER: You mentioned these problems started after the 2018 protests. Were you involved in those protests in any way?

APPLICANT: No. I… I was too scared. I just… I went to church.

OFFICER: So, you were not involved in any political activities?

APPLICANT: No. Just… just my religion.

OFFICER: Ms. Rodriguez, your application states that you left Nicaragua on January 15, 2023. Is that correct?

APPLICANT: Yes, that is correct.

OFFICER: Can you describe your journey to the United States?

APPLICANT: I flew to… to Mexico. And then… I crossed the border.

OFFICER: How did you cross the border?

APPLICANT: With a… a coyote.

OFFICER: Did you have any trouble crossing the border?

APPLICANT: It was… difficult. But I made it.

OFFICER: Did you have any encounters with law enforcement in Mexico?

APPLICANT: No.

OFFICER: Ms. Rodriguez, you mentioned that you worked as a waitress. Do you have any other skills or training?

APPLICANT: No. Just… waitress.

OFFICER: If granted asylum, what kind of work would you like to do in the United States?

APPLICANT: I would like to work… in a restaurant. If someone will hire me.

OFFICER: Ms. Rodriguez, you stated earlier that the police came to your church during a service and yelled at your pastor. But in your written declaration, you stated that the police physically assaulted your pastor during that incident. Which is accurate?

APPLICANT: [Hesitates] Uh… maybe… maybe I was mistaken in the declaration. They… they yelled very loudly. It was… very frightening.

OFFICER: So, they did not physically assault him?

APPLICANT: No. Not… not that time.

OFFICER: Ms. Rodriguez, your application states that you are the sole supporter of your elderly mother back in Nicaragua. Is that correct?

APPLICANT: Yes, that is correct.

OFFICER: How do you provide for her financially from the United States?

APPLICANT: I send her money. When I can.

OFFICER: How much money do you send, and how often?

APPLICANT: It depends. Maybe… fifty dollars a month? Sometimes more. Sometimes less. It is hard to find work.

OFFICER: What kind of work are you currently doing in the United States?

APPLICANT: I am… cleaning houses. When I can find work.

OFFICER: Do you have any documents to support your claim that you send money to your mother?

APPLICANT: No. I send it… through a friend.

OFFICER: So, there is no record of these transactions?

APPLICANT: No.

OFFICER: Ms. Rodriguez, are there any other reasons why you are afraid to return to Nicaragua?

APPLICANT: No. Just… just the religion.

OFFICER: Ms. Rodriguez, I am going to ask you a few more questions about your journey to the United States. You stated that you hired a coyote to cross the border. How much did you pay this coyote?

APPLICANT: Uh… I don’t remember exactly. Maybe… five thousand dollars?

OFFICER: Where did you get that money?

APPLICANT: I… I sold my house.

OFFICER: You sold your house? Do you have any documentation to prove that you owned a house and that you sold it?

APPLICANT: No. It was… a long time ago. And… everything was done… informally.

OFFICER: So, there is no record of you owning or selling a house?

APPLICANT: No.

OFFICER: Ms. Rodriguez, I am concerned about some inconsistencies in your testimony. You stated that the police did not physically assault your pastor, but your written declaration states otherwise. You also stated that you sold your house to pay for your journey to the United States, but you have no documentation to support that claim. Additionally, you say you send money to your mother but have no record of that. Can you explain these inconsistencies?

APPLICANT: I… I am sorry. I am very nervous. I… I just want to be safe. And I am telling the truth. About the religion. They… they hate us.

ATTORNEY: Officer, my client is under a great deal of stress. I believe she is doing her best to recall events accurately.

OFFICER: I understand, Counsel. However, the inconsistencies are concerning. Ms. Rodriguez, do you have any other evidence to support your claim that you fear persecution in Nicaragua? Any photos, videos, or letters?

APPLICANT: No. I… I just have my faith.

OFFICER: Ms. Rodriguez, thank you for your time. I have no further questions at this time. Your attorney may have some questions for you.

ATTORNEY: Thank you, Officer. Ms. Rodriguez, can you tell me again, in your own words, why you believe your life would be in danger if you were forced to return to Nicaragua?

APPLICANT: Because… because they will arrest me. For being Christian. They will say I am… a bad person. And they will… they will hurt me. I know it.

ATTORNEY: Thank you, Ms. Rodriguez. I have no further questions.

OFFICER: Thank you, Counsel. Ms. Rodriguez, this interview is now concluded. We will review your application and your testimony, and you will receive a decision in the mail. Do you understand?

APPLICANT: Yes. Thank you, Officer.
