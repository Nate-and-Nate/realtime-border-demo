INTERVIEW BEGINS

OFFICER: Good morning, Ms. Elena Rodriguez. My name is Officer Miller, and I am an asylum officer with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Thank you for coming in today. As you know, you are in removal proceedings, and you have applied for asylum as a defense against being deported back to Honduras. I need to inform you that I am under oath to tell the truth, just as you will be. The purpose of this interview is to determine whether you meet the legal requirements for asylum under U.S. law. Do you understand?

APPLICANT: Yes, Officer. I understand.

OFFICER: Before we begin, I need to swear you in. Please raise your right hand and repeat after me: Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

APPLICANT: I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God.

OFFICER: Thank you. Please be seated. Let's start with some basic background information. Can you please state your full name and date of birth for the record?

APPLICANT: My full name is Elena Maria Rodriguez, and my date of birth is October 12, 1980.

OFFICER: And where were you born?

APPLICANT: I was born in Tegucigalpa, Honduras.

OFFICER: Ms. Rodriguez, you indicated on your application that you are seeking asylum based on fear of persecution due to your membership in a particular social group. Can you tell me about that?

APPLICANT: Yes, Officer. I am seeking asylum because I am afraid to go back to Honduras. I was, uh, a leader, a *guia* for the women in my church, the Asamblea de Dios church. I helped them, I taught them, I prayed with them. Because of this, I was targeted by the gangs, the *maras*.

OFFICER: Can you elaborate on what you mean by "leader" or *guia*? What specifically did you do?

APPLICANT: I, uh, I led the women's group in my church. We would meet twice a week. I would read scripture, and we would talk about our problems, about how to be good wives and mothers, and how to stay strong in our faith. I also organized outreach programs, like helping the poor in our neighborhood. We would collect food and clothing for them. I also visited women in the hospital and prayed for them.

OFFICER: And why did this leadership role make you a target for the gangs?

APPLICANT: Because, the *maras*, they don't like strong women. They don't like women who are independent and who teach other women to be strong. They want women to be afraid and dependent on them. Also, they thought that because I helped people, I must have money. They started demanding money from me – extortion.

OFFICER: When did this extortion begin? Can you give me a specific date or timeframe?

APPLICANT: It started about, um, maybe six months after I became the *guia*, so around maybe… April 2022. They first sent a young boy to my house. He said that I needed to pay them *la renta*, protection money. He said if I didn’t pay, something bad would happen to me or my family.

OFFICER: How often did they demand money?

APPLICANT: At first, it was once a month. Then it became every two weeks. Then every week.

OFFICER: How much money were they demanding?

APPLICANT: At first, it was 500 Lempiras. Then it went up to 1000. Then 2000. I couldn't afford it. I am a construction worker, I don’t make much.

OFFICER: You mentioned you are a construction worker. Can you tell me more about your work experience?

APPLICANT: Yes. I, uh, I learned to build houses from my father. He was a builder. I helped him since I was a young girl. I can do bricklaying, I can do cement work, I can do roofing. I can do most things related to building. It’s hard work, especially for a woman, but I am strong. I have to be.

OFFICER: Did you have any formal training or certifications in construction?

APPLICANT: No, Officer. No formal training. I learned everything from my father, watching him and helping him. It was all practical experience.

OFFICER: You said the *maras* demanded money. What happened when you couldn't pay?

APPLICANT: The first time I couldn't pay the full amount, they sent me a message. They threw a dead dog in my yard. It was horrible. My daughter was very scared. Then, a few weeks later, two men came to my house late at night. They started banging on the door and shouting threats. They said they would kill me and my daughter if I didn't pay.

OFFICER: Did you recognize these men?

APPLICANT: No, Officer. It was dark, and they had their faces covered. But I knew they were from the *mara*. Everyone in my neighborhood knew.

OFFICER: Did you report these incidents to the police?

APPLICANT: Yes, Officer. I went to the police station. But they didn't do anything. They said they couldn't protect me. They said the *maras* were too powerful. They told me to just pay them what they wanted. They are corrupt, the police.

OFFICER: Did you try to relocate within Honduras to avoid the *maras*?

APPLICANT: Yes, Officer. I tried. I went to live with my sister in San Pedro Sula for a few months. But the *maras* are everywhere. They found me there too. They started calling me on my phone, demanding money again. They knew where I lived. My sister was also afraid. So, I had to leave.

OFFICER: How did they get your phone number and address in San Pedro Sula?

APPLICANT: I don’t know for sure, Officer. But I think someone in my old neighborhood told them. Or maybe someone at my sister's work. They have people everywhere.

OFFICER: After you left your sister’s house, what did you do?

APPLICANT: I went back to Tegucigalpa, but I didn't go back to my house. I stayed with different friends and family members, moving around, trying to hide. But I was always afraid. I couldn't sleep. I knew they would find me eventually.

OFFICER: Why couldn't you continue to move around and hide?

APPLICANT: Because it was not a life, Officer. I was always looking over my shoulder. I couldn't work. I couldn't provide for my daughter. And I knew it was only a matter of time before they found me. They are very persistent. And I was afraid for my daughter. I didn’t want her to be hurt.

OFFICER: You mentioned your daughter. How old is she?

APPLICANT: She is 16 years old. Her name is Sofia. She is here with me. She is also on the application.

OFFICER: Is she also afraid to return to Honduras?

APPLICANT: Yes, Officer. She is very afraid. She saw what happened to me. She knows how dangerous it is. And she is also targeted because she is my daughter. The *maras* think they can use her to get to me.

OFFICER: Can you explain more about that? Why would the *maras* target your daughter specifically?

APPLICANT: Because she is a young woman. They want to control her. They want to force her to be with them, to be their girlfriend. They do this to many young girls in our neighborhood. It is a way for them to show their power. And also, they thought she knew where I was hiding my money. Which I had very little of, of course.

OFFICER: Do you have any evidence to support your claims, such as police reports, medical records, or photos?

APPLICANT: I have the police report from when I reported the threats and the dead dog. It's not much, but it's something. I also have a letter from my pastor at the Asamblea de Dios church. He knows what happened to me. He can testify that I was a leader in the church and that I was being threatened by the *maras*. My daughter also has some photos she took of the dead dog in our yard before we reported it. I submitted those with my application.

OFFICER: Let's talk about your travel to the United States. Can you describe your journey?

APPLICANT: It was very difficult, Officer. I left Honduras in, uh, September 2023. I traveled with a *coyote*. It was expensive. We walked for many days. We crossed through Guatemala and Mexico. It was very dangerous. There were many other people with me, including women and children. We were robbed and threatened by criminals. I was very scared for my daughter.

OFFICER: How did you enter the United States?

APPLICANT: We crossed the border near Texas. I turned myself in to the border patrol.

OFFICER: Why did you come to the United States specifically?

APPLICANT: Because I knew I could find safety here. I have a cousin who lives in Houston. She told me I could come and stay with her. And I knew that the United States is a country that believes in freedom and justice. I hoped that I could find protection here.

OFFICER: What are your plans if you are granted asylum in the United States?

APPLICANT: I want to work and provide for my daughter. I want her to be able to go to school and have a good future. I want to contribute to this country. I can work in construction. I know how to build houses. I can also clean houses, I am a hard worker. I am willing to do anything to support myself and my daughter.

OFFICER: You mentioned your construction skills. Are you familiar with construction codes and practices in the United States?

APPLICANT: No, Officer, not yet. But I am willing to learn. I am a quick learner. I can take classes and get certified. I am determined to make a good life for myself and my daughter here.

OFFICER: Do you have any family members in Honduras who are still at risk?

APPLICANT: Yes, Officer. My mother is still there. She is old and sick. I am very worried about her. The *maras* know that she is my mother. They could hurt her to get to me. I try to send her money when I can, but it is difficult.

OFFICER: Have you contacted your mother since arriving in the United States?

APPLICANT: Yes, Officer. I call her every week. But I am always afraid that the *maras* are listening.

OFFICER: Ms. Rodriguez, is there anything else you would like to add? Anything that you think is important for me to know in considering your case?

APPLICANT: Yes, Officer. I just want to say that I am telling the truth. I am not trying to take advantage of the system. I am genuinely afraid to go back to Honduras. I believe that my life and my daughter's life are in danger if we are forced to return. I just want to be safe and have a chance to build a new life here. I can contribute to this country, I promise. And I will always be grateful for the opportunity. Also, being a church leader, a woman of God, is very important to me. I want to continue serving my community and helping others, as I did in Honduras, but in a safe environment. I feel called to that purpose.

OFFICER: Thank you, Ms. Rodriguez. I appreciate your honesty and your willingness to share your story with me. I have no further questions at this time. We will notify you of our decision in writing.

APPLICANT: Thank you, Officer. Thank you for listening.
