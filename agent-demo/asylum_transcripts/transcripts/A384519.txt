INTERVIEW BEGINS

OFFICER: Good morning, Mr. Nkem. My name is Officer Davis, and I'm an Asylum Officer with USCIS. This interview is to determine if you are eligible for asylum in the United States. Please raise your right hand. Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I swear.

OFFICER: Thank you. Please be seated. I want to explain the process. I will be asking you questions about your background, your life in Cameroon, and why you left. Your answers will help me decide whether you have a well-founded fear of persecution if you return. I will be recording this interview. Do you understand?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes, I understand.

OFFICER: You stated on your Form I-589 that you fear returning to Cameroon because of your political opinion. Is that correct?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes, that is correct.

OFFICER: Let's begin with your background. Can you please state your full name and date of birth for the record?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) My full name is Nkem Chukwu. My date of birth is July 12, 1991.

OFFICER: And where in Cameroon were you born?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I was born in Bamenda, in the Northwest Region.

OFFICER: What is the highest level of education you completed?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I finished secondary school. I have the GCE Advanced Level certificate.

OFFICER: Can you describe what subjects you studied in secondary school?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes. I studied mathematics, physics, chemistry, and further mathematics.

OFFICER: So, a STEM-focused curriculum. After secondary school, did you pursue any further education or training?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) No, I did not have the money to go to university. My family... we were not rich. I tried to find work.

OFFICER: What kind of work did you find?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I worked as a technician. I repaired computers and mobile phones. I learned on my own, and then I worked in a small shop.

OFFICER: How long did you work as a technician?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) For about five years, before… before the problems started.

OFFICER: Let’s talk about those problems. You mentioned your political opinion. Can you tell me what your political opinion is?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I support the independence of Ambazonia. I believe the English-speaking regions of Cameroon should be independent.

OFFICER: How did you express this opinion?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) In the beginning, just with friends, in secret. But then, I started to share things on social media, on Facebook. I also attended some peaceful protests.

OFFICER: When did you start attending these protests?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Around 2017, when the Anglophone crisis started.

OFFICER: Can you describe one of these protests? Where was it, and what happened?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes. It was in Bamenda, in October 2017. It was a peaceful march, to demand equal rights and the release of people who had been arrested for protesting. We were carrying flags of Ambazonia and singing songs.

OFFICER: And what happened?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) The military came. They started shooting. Not in the air, but at the people. People were running, screaming. I saw people get hurt. I managed to escape, but I was very scared.

OFFICER: Were you injured at that protest?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) (Through interpreter) No, but… I saw my friend, Emmanuel, get shot in the leg.

OFFICER: Did you report this incident to the police?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) No! The police are part of the problem. They are the ones who arrest and beat people who support Ambazonia. Reporting to them would be like… like asking the wolf for help from the sheep.

OFFICER: Did you continue to participate in protests after this?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes, but I was more careful. I tried to stay in the back, to not be seen. I also stopped posting on Facebook using my real name.

OFFICER: You stated in your application that you were arrested. Can you tell me about that?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes. It was in March 2019. I was walking home from work when the military stopped me. They asked for my ID. When they saw my name, they said I was on a list. They said I was a "secessionist."

OFFICER: What happened after they arrested you?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) They took me to a military camp. I was there for three days. They beat me, they interrogated me. They wanted me to tell them who else was involved in the movement.

OFFICER: Can you describe the beating?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) (Through interpreter) They used their fists, their boots. They hit me on my head, my back, my stomach. It was very painful.

OFFICER: Did you receive any medical treatment for these injuries?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) No. When they released me, I was too afraid to go to a hospital. I went home and my mother helped me. She cleaned my wounds and gave me traditional medicine.

OFFICER: Why were you released?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I don’t know for sure. Maybe they didn’t have enough evidence. Maybe they were just tired of beating me. But they warned me. They said if they saw me again, they would kill me.

OFFICER: After you were released, what did you do?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I stayed in my house for a few days, hiding. I was afraid to go out. Then, my family and I decided I had to leave Bamenda.

OFFICER: Where did you go?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I went to Douala. My uncle lived there. I stayed with him for a few months.

OFFICER: Did you feel safe in Douala?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) (Through interpreter) Not really. Douala is a bigger city, but the government is everywhere. I was always afraid they would find me. Also, I had no way to make money. I could not find a job.

OFFICER: Did you report your arrest and the beating to any authorities in Douala?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) No. I didn’t trust anyone. The government is the government, no matter where you are.

OFFICER: You said earlier that you were a victim of trafficking. Can you please explain the circumstances of that?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) (Through interpreter) Yes. While I was in Douala, I met a man who said he could help me get to Europe. He said he knew people who could arrange everything. I gave him all the money I had saved, and he promised to get me a visa and a plane ticket. But then, he took my money and disappeared. I later learned that he was part of a trafficking ring, preying on desperate people like me. I was very naive.

OFFICER: How did you eventually leave Cameroon?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) After the man stole my money, I was desperate. I contacted a different person, someone who said they could get me to America. It was very expensive, and very dangerous. I had to sell my mother's land to get the money.

OFFICER: Can you describe your journey to the United States?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) (Through interpreter) Yes. I flew to Ecuador. Then, I traveled by land through Colombia, Panama, and Mexico. It was a long and difficult journey. I saw many terrible things. I was afraid every day.

OFFICER: When did you arrive in the United States?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) (Through interpreter) I arrived in the United States in July 2022.

OFFICER: And how did you enter the United States?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) (Through interpreter) I crossed the border near San Ysidro, California. I turned myself in to the border patrol and asked for asylum.

OFFICER: Mr. Nkem, why can’t you return to Cameroon?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) (Through interpreter) Because the government will kill me. They know I support Ambazonia. They have arrested me once, and they said they would kill me if they saw me again. I am afraid for my life.

OFFICER: Do you have any family members in Cameroon?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes, my mother and my younger sister.

OFFICER: Are they also at risk because of your political opinion?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) (Through interpreter) Yes, I believe so. After I left, the military came to my house looking for me. They questioned my mother and sister. They threatened them. I am afraid they will be hurt because of me.

OFFICER: Have you submitted any evidence to support your asylum claim?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes, I submitted a copy of my GCE Advanced Level certificate, my arrest report, and some articles about the Anglophone crisis.

OFFICER: I have reviewed those documents. Do you have any other evidence that you would like to present at this time?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) No, that is all I have.

OFFICER: If you are granted asylum in the United States, what are your plans?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) (Through interpreter) I want to work. I want to use my skills to repair computers and mobile phones. I want to learn more, maybe go to school. I want to build a new life here, a safe life.

OFFICER: Do you speak any English?

APPLICANT: (In English, hesitantly) A little. I am learning.

OFFICER: (In English) Okay, Mr. Nkem. That’s good. We have programs that can help you improve your English. (Through interpreter) Are you willing to take advantage of such programs?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes, of course. I want to learn English better.

OFFICER: Mr. Nkem, I noticed that the arrest report you provided does not explicitly mention your political activities. It simply states you were arrested for "public disturbance." Can you explain this discrepancy?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) (Through interpreter) Yes. The police… they don’t always write down the real reason for the arrest. They often use vague terms like "public disturbance" to hide their political motives. Everyone in Bamenda knows that if you are arrested for "public disturbance" and you are Anglophone, it is probably because of your political views.

OFFICER: I understand. One final question: can you describe a specific event that convinced you that your life was in imminent danger if you remained in Cameroon?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) (Through interpreter) Yes. After I was released from the military camp, one of the soldiers followed me. He didn't arrest me, but he followed me to my house. He stood outside my house for a long time, watching. I knew then that they were not going to leave me alone. That is when I knew I had to leave.

OFFICER: Thank you, Mr. Nkem. I have no further questions for you at this time. Do you have anything else you would like to add?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) (Through interpreter) Yes. I just want to say that I am telling the truth. I am afraid to go back to Cameroon. I am asking for your help to protect me.

OFFICER: Thank you. This interview is now concluded. We will notify you of our decision in writing. Please make sure you keep your address updated with USCIS.

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Thank you. Thank you very much.
