INTERVIEW BEGINS

OFFICER: Good morning, Mr. Volkov. My name is Officer Miller, and this is Asylum Officer Interview Number AO-7100. Present with you is your attorney, Ms. Chen. I need to explain the purpose of this interview and administer an oath. The purpose of this interview is to determine whether you are eligible for asylum in the United States. I will be asking you questions about your background and your reasons for fearing return to Russia. Your answers will be recorded. It is very important that you understand that you must tell the truth. Do you understand?

APPLICANT: Yes, I understand.

OFFICER: Ms. Chen, for the record, please state your name and bar number.

ATTORNEY: Sarah Chen, Bar Number 12345.

OFFICER: Mr. Volkov, please raise your right hand. Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

APPLICANT: I do.

OFFICER: Thank you. Please be seated. Let's begin with some background information. Could you please state your full name and date of birth for the record?

APPLICANT: My name is Dimitri Volkov, and my date of birth is March 15, 1976.

OFFICER: And can you confirm your nationality is Russian?

APPLICANT: Yes, I am Russian.

OFFICER: You stated in your application that you are seeking asylum based on your membership in a particular social group. Can you tell me more about that?

APPLICANT: Yes. I am… I am afraid because of my… my belonging to the… the business community. I was targeted.

OFFICER: Targeted by whom, Mr. Volkov?

APPLICANT: By… by corrupt officials and… and criminal elements connected to them. They wanted my business.

OFFICER: Let’s go back a bit. Can you describe your education for me?

APPLICANT: I finished secondary school, you know, high school, in Moscow. After that, I didn’t go to university. My family needed me to work, to help with the finances.

OFFICER: So, you only completed secondary education?

APPLICANT: Yes, that's right.

OFFICER: Your application mentions work experience in finance and business. Can you elaborate on that?

APPLICANT: Yes, after school I started working as a… like a clerk, you know, in a small import-export company. Gradually, I learned the business, and I became a manager. Later, I started my own company, a small trading firm.

OFFICER: What kind of goods did your trading firm import and export?

APPLICANT: Mostly electronics… and… and some textiles. Things like that. Consumer goods.

OFFICER: And how long were you in business for yourself?

APPLICANT: About… about seven years, I think. From 2014 until… until I left Russia in 2021.

OFFICER: Now, you said you were targeted. Can you describe the first incident that made you fear for your safety?

APPLICANT: It was… early 2020. I received a call from… a man. He didn't identify himself, but he said I needed to “cooperate” with… with a certain individual. He implied that if I didn’t, things would go badly for me and my family.

OFFICER: Did he specify what "cooperation" meant?

APPLICANT: He said… he said I needed to give him a percentage of my profits. A very large percentage. Almost all of it.

OFFICER: Did you report this to the police?

APPLICANT: No. Absolutely not. The police… they are part of the problem. Everyone knows this. Reporting would have made things worse.

OFFICER: Why do you say that "everyone knows this?" Do you have specific evidence that the police are corrupt in this way?

APPLICANT: It's common knowledge. You read about it in the news… everyone talks about it. It's just how things are in Russia. I didn't have any… you know, specific proof, but I knew.

OFFICER: Can you give me an example of a specific news article that details this type of police corruption?

APPLICANT: (Hesitates) I… I don't remember the specific article right now. There were many.

OFFICER: You said this happened in early 2020. What happened after you received that phone call?

APPLICANT: I tried to ignore it. I hoped it was just… a one-time thing. But then, a few weeks later, my office was… vandalized. Windows broken, things thrown around. Nothing stolen, just… damage.

OFFICER: Did you report the vandalism to the police?

APPLICANT: No. For the same reason. It would have been useless. And dangerous.

OFFICER: So, you never reported any of these incidents to the authorities?

APPLICANT: No. Never.

OFFICER: What happened next?

APPLICANT: Things escalated. They started… following me. I saw the same car parked near my apartment, near my office. I felt… watched all the time.

OFFICER: Did you ever see who was in the car? Can you describe the car?

APPLICANT: It was a black… I think a black BMW. I only saw it from a distance. I didn't see the people inside clearly. They were wearing… dark glasses.

OFFICER: And what was the final incident that made you decide to leave Russia?

APPLICANT: It was… in September 2021. I was… I was attacked.

OFFICER: Can you describe the attack in detail?

APPLICANT: I was walking home from a restaurant. It was late, maybe 11 pm. Two men… they jumped me. They beat me… badly. They didn't say anything, they just… hit me.

OFFICER: Where on your body were you hit?

APPLICANT: Mostly… mostly my face and chest. I had… I had a broken rib, I think. And… and a black eye.

OFFICER: Did you seek medical attention?

APPLICANT: Yes. I went to a private clinic. I didn't want to go to a state hospital.

OFFICER: Why not?

APPLICANT: Because… I was afraid they would report it to the police. And then… more trouble.

OFFICER: Do you have any medical records from this private clinic?

APPLICANT: No. I… I paid in cash. I didn't want a record of it.

OFFICER: You said this happened in September 2021. You arrived in the United States in October 2021. That’s a very short time. How did you arrange your travel so quickly?

APPLICANT: I had… a friend. He helped me. He knew people… who could arrange things.

OFFICER: What kind of “people” are you referring to?

APPLICANT: People who… who can get you a visa quickly. And a plane ticket. For a price.

OFFICER: So, you paid someone to expedite your visa application?

APPLICANT: I… I wouldn't say "expedite." I would say… "assist." It was… complicated.

OFFICER: Mr. Volkov, did you pay someone to obtain your visa through illicit means?

ATTORNEY: Officer, I advise my client not to answer that question, as it may incriminate him.

OFFICER: Okay. Let's move on. What route did you take to the United States?

APPLICANT: I flew from Moscow to… to Frankfurt. And then from Frankfurt to New York.

OFFICER: Did you apply for asylum at the airport in New York?

APPLICANT: No. I… I waited. I wanted to… to get settled first. And talk to a lawyer.

OFFICER: Why did you wait?

APPLICANT: I… I wasn't sure what to do. I needed time to think.

OFFICER: You mentioned your family. Are they still in Russia?

APPLICANT: I have… I had a wife. We are… we are separated now.

OFFICER: Are you legally divorced?

APPLICANT: No. Not yet. It's… complicated.

OFFICER: Is she in danger?

APPLICANT: I… I don't know. We don't talk anymore.

OFFICER: In your application, you stated that you have no dependent family members. Is that correct?

APPLICANT: Yes, that is correct.

OFFICER: If granted asylum, what are your plans for the future here in the United States?

APPLICANT: I want to… to start a business again. I have experience in… in trading. I think I can… contribute to the American economy.

OFFICER: You mentioned you only completed secondary education. Do you think that will be a barrier to starting a business here?

APPLICANT: I… I have a lot of practical experience. I learned a lot… on the job. I am a quick learner.

OFFICER: Have you taken any steps to investigate the business environment in the US, or to improve your education or skillset?

APPLICANT: I have been… reading articles online. About… about starting a business.

OFFICER: Mr. Volkov, your application states that your fear stems from corrupt officials targeting your business. However, you mentioned that your business was relatively small. Can you explain why these officials would target a small business like yours?

APPLICANT: (Hesitates) It wasn't… always small. It was… growing. They saw potential. And… they wanted a piece of it.

OFFICER: But you also stated that you didn't report any of the incidents to the police because you feared them. If the police are corrupt, why would these officials need to target you directly? Wouldn't the police simply shut down your business on their behalf?

APPLICANT: (Long pause) I… I don't know. Maybe… maybe they wanted to scare me first. To… to make me more willing to cooperate.

OFFICER: Mr. Volkov, you stated that you were attacked in September 2021. However, you also said that you didn't seek medical attention at a state hospital because you feared the police. If you were genuinely afraid for your life, wouldn't you prioritize your health and safety over the risk of police involvement?

APPLICANT: I… I was very scared. But I was also… trying to be careful. I didn't want to… draw attention to myself.

OFFICER: You also mentioned that a "friend" helped you obtain a visa quickly. Given the circumstances you've described, it sounds as though you obtained your visa fraudulently. Why should I grant you asylum when you may have misrepresented yourself to enter the country?

ATTORNEY: Officer, I must object. You are pressuring my client.

OFFICER: I am simply trying to understand the facts of the case. Mr. Volkov, do you have any further evidence that you would like to submit in support of your application?

APPLICANT: I… I don't have anything else right now.

OFFICER: Okay. I have no further questions at this time. Ms. Chen, do you have any questions for your client?

ATTORNEY: No, Officer. Thank you.

OFFICER: Mr. Volkov, this interview is now concluded. You will receive a written decision in the mail. Thank you for your time.
