INTERVIEW BEGINS

OFFICER: Good morning, Ms. Rodriguez. My name is Officer Miller, and I'm an Asylum Officer with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Thank you for coming in today. I need to explain the purpose of this interview and swear you in. This interview is to determine whether you qualify for asylum in the United States. I will ask you questions about your background, your experiences in Cuba, and your reasons for coming to the United States. It is very important that you answer all my questions truthfully and completely. Do you understand?

APPLICANT: Yes, Officer Miller. I understand.

OFFICER: Great. Before we begin, I need to administer an oath. Please raise your right hand and repeat after me: "I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God."

APPLICANT: I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God.

OFFICER: Thank you. Please be seated. Your file indicates that you are representing yourself in this matter. Is that correct?

APPLICANT: Yes, that is correct. I couldn't afford a lawyer.

OFFICER: Alright. Let's start with some background information. Could you please state your full name and date of birth for the record?

APPLICANT: My full name is Elena Maria Rodriguez Diaz. My date of birth is October 15, 1976.

OFFICER: And your current address in the United States?

APPLICANT: 14 Oak Street, Apartment 2B, Miami, Florida.

OFFICER: Thank you. Your application states you are a citizen of Cuba. Is that correct?

APPLICANT: Yes, I am.

OFFICER: And you are seeking asylum based on fear of persecution due to your religion. Can you elaborate on that?

APPLICANT: Yes. In Cuba, practicing my religion openly was becoming increasingly dangerous.

OFFICER: What is your religion?

APPLICANT: I am a practitioner of Santeria.

OFFICER: Okay. Tell me more about practicing Santeria in Cuba. What specific problems did you face?

APPLICANT: Well, it's… it's not officially recognized, you see? The government tolerates Catholicism, but other religions, especially Afro-Cuban religions like Santeria… they are viewed with suspicion.

OFFICER: Suspicion. What does that mean in practice?

APPLICANT: It means… well, the police would harass us. They would raid our ceremonies, confiscate our religious objects. They accused us of… of being involved in illegal activities.

OFFICER: Can you give me a specific example of a time when the police harassed you or raided a ceremony?

APPLICANT: Yes, of course. About two years ago, in November of 2021, we were holding a ceremony at my house. It was a… a celebration for Elegua. The police came. They broke down the door. They arrested everyone. They held us for three days and accused us of… disturbing the peace. They took our drums, our altars, everything.

OFFICER: Where did this happen?

APPLICANT: In Havana, in my neighborhood of Centro Habana.

OFFICER: Were you personally injured during this raid?

APPLICANT: No, not physically. But I was… humiliated. Scared.

OFFICER: You said "everyone" was arrested. Can you name some of the other people who were arrested?

APPLICANT: Uh… Let me see. There was… Miguel, my friend. And… and Carlos, he plays the drums. And… uh… Maria, she is a priestess. I don't remember all the names.

OFFICER: Do you have any documentation to prove this raid occurred? Any police reports, medical records, anything like that?

APPLICANT: No, I don't. The police never give you anything. Everything is done… unofficially.

OFFICER: Okay. You mentioned that you have a secondary education and a background in Legal. Can you describe your educational history in more detail?

APPLICANT: Yes, I completed secondary school in Havana. It was called… the Instituto Preuniversitario Vladimir Ilich Lenin. Then, I studied law at the University of Havana.

OFFICER: You studied law? Did you graduate?

APPLICANT: No, I didn't. I… I had to drop out. My mother became ill, and I had to take care of her.

OFFICER: So, you didn't complete your law degree?

APPLICANT: No, not completely. I finished most of the courses, but I didn't take the final exams.

OFFICER: Your application states you worked in the legal field. Can you describe your professional experience?

APPLICANT: Yes. After I had to leave the university, I worked as a legal assistant for a lawyer in Havana. I prepared documents, researched cases, that kind of thing.

OFFICER: What was the name of the lawyer you worked for?

APPLICANT: His name was… Dr. Ricardo Alvarez.

OFFICER: How long did you work for Dr. Alvarez?

APPLICANT: About… five years, I think. From 2000 to 2005.

OFFICER: Did you ever attempt to report the harassment you experienced because of your religion to the authorities?

APPLICANT: No. Reporting to the authorities would have been… useless. They are the ones who are doing the harassing! Who would I report them to?

OFFICER: Did you consider moving to another part of Cuba where you might be able to practice your religion more freely?

APPLICANT: I did. I thought about moving to Santiago de Cuba. But… I heard that the situation there was just as bad, maybe even worse. And my family was in Havana. I couldn't just leave them.

OFFICER: Your application mentions that you have family ties to U.S. citizens. Can you explain that?

APPLICANT: Yes. My sister, Isabella, she lives in New Jersey. She has been a citizen for about ten years.

OFFICER: Has your sister ever petitioned for you to immigrate to the United States?

APPLICANT: No, she hasn't. She… she has her own family to worry about. And the process is very long, very complicated.

OFFICER: Why do you believe you cannot return to Cuba?

APPLICANT: Because if I go back, they will continue to harass me. They might even arrest me again. I am afraid for my life.

OFFICER: You said "they." Who are you referring to specifically?

APPLICANT: The police. The government. They see Santeria as a threat.

OFFICER: Are you aware of other practitioners of Santeria who have been arrested or harmed in Cuba?

APPLICANT: Yes, I am. I have heard stories. I don't know the people personally, but… everyone knows.

OFFICER: Can you provide any specific names or incidents?

APPLICANT: Well… I heard about a babalawo, a priest, in Matanzas who was imprisoned for… for using animals in his ceremonies. I don't know his name, but… that's what I heard.

OFFICER: You mentioned that you came to the United States. Can you describe your journey?

APPLICANT: Yes. I flew from Havana to Cancun, Mexico. Then, I took another flight to Miami.

OFFICER: When did you arrive in the United States?

APPLICANT: August 15th, 2023.

OFFICER: You entered the United States on a tourist visa, correct?

APPLICANT: Yes, that's right.

OFFICER: Did you tell the immigration officer at the airport that you intended to seek asylum in the United States?

APPLICANT: No, I didn't. I was afraid they wouldn't let me in.

OFFICER: If granted asylum, what are your plans for the future?

APPLICANT: I want to work. I want to contribute to this country. I have skills. I can… I can help people with legal issues.

OFFICER: But you said you didn't finish your law degree.

APPLICANT: No, but I have experience. I can work as a paralegal. I can study and maybe one day… finish my degree here.

OFFICER: Do you have any other family members in Cuba who might be at risk if you are granted asylum here?

APPLICANT: Yes, my husband and my son are still in Cuba. They are also practitioners of Santeria. They are at risk because of their association with me.

OFFICER: What is your husband's name and date of birth?

APPLICANT: His name is Ricardo Gómez and his date of birth is July 4, 1972.

OFFICER: And your son's name and date of birth?

APPLICANT: His name is David Gómez Rodriguez and his date of birth is March 10, 2005.

OFFICER: Did you submit any evidence with your application, such as photographs, documents, or affidavits?

APPLICANT: Yes, I submitted a copy of my passport, my birth certificate, and a letter from my sister, Isabella, saying that I can stay with her.

OFFICER: I see. Ms. Rodriguez, I have a few more questions. You stated that you are afraid to return to Cuba because of your religion. However, Santeria is practiced openly by many people in Cuba, and while the government may have some level of surveillance, it does not actively persecute all practitioners. Can you explain why you believe *you* are at particular risk?

APPLICANT: It's… it's hard to explain. I think… I think because I am more… visible. I am a leader in my community. I am a… a voice for my people. That makes me a target.

OFFICER: You also mentioned that you worked as a legal assistant for five years. However, you also said that you had to leave the university because you had to care for your sick mother. Can you clarify the timeline? When did your mother become ill, and when did you begin working as a legal assistant?

APPLICANT: My mother became ill around 1998. I left the university in 1999. I started working for Dr. Alvarez in 2000.

OFFICER: So, you were caring for your sick mother *while* attending university?

APPLICANT: Yes, it was… difficult.

OFFICER: And you were able to complete most of the course work, but not the final exams?

APPLICANT: Yes.

OFFICER: Ms. Rodriguez, your testimony suggests you were a leader in your religious community, yet you didn't know the names of everyone who was arrested with you during the police raid. This seems inconsistent. Can you explain this?

APPLICANT: I… I know some of the names. It was a long time ago. I was very scared. My memory is not perfect.

OFFICER: Okay. I have no further questions for you at this time. Do you have anything else you would like to add?

APPLICANT: No, I think I have said everything. Thank you for listening to me.

OFFICER: Thank you for your time, Ms. Rodriguez. We will notify you of our decision in writing.
