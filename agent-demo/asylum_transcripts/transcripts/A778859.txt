INTERVIEW BEGINS

OFFICER: Good morning. My name is Officer Reynolds, and I am an Asylum Officer with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. This is an interview regarding your application for asylum in the United States. With me today is your attorney, Ms. Alvarez.

ATTORNEY: Good morning, Officer Reynolds.

OFFICER: Ms. Alvarez, please confirm for the record that you are representing the applicant in this matter.

ATTORNEY: Yes, Officer Reynolds, I am.

OFFICER: Thank you. Now, [Applicant's Name], do you understand that I am going to ask you questions about your claim for asylum? You are under oath, which means you must tell the truth. Do you understand?

APPLICANT: Yes, I understand.

OFFICER: Please raise your right hand and repeat after me: "I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God."

APPLICANT: I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God.

OFFICER: Thank you. Please be seated. Let’s start with some background information. Can you please state your full name and date of birth for the record?

APPLICANT: My name is Mateo Rodriguez, and my date of birth is July 12, 1996.

OFFICER: Thank you. And what is your current address in the United States?

APPLICANT: 14 Oak Street, Apartment 2B, Anytown, USA.

OFFICER: Okay. You are seeking asylum based on a fear of persecution due to your political opinion in Honduras. Is that correct?

APPLICANT: Yes, that is correct.

OFFICER: Let's start with your background in Honduras. Can you tell me about where you lived, your family, and your life before coming to the United States?

APPLICANT: I lived in Tegucigalpa, the capital. I lived with my mother and my younger sister. My father… he left when I was young. Life was… complicated. We weren’t wealthy. My mother worked very hard as a seamstress. I tried to help as much as I could.

OFFICER: What kind of help did you provide?

APPLICANT: After school, I worked at a small restaurant washing dishes and sometimes helping with food prep. It wasn’t much, but it helped my mother with the bills.

OFFICER: You mentioned school. What is the highest level of education you completed?

APPLICANT: I completed secondary education – high school. I graduated in 2014.

OFFICER: Do you have any documentation to support your education?

APPLICANT: Yes, I submitted a copy of my diploma with my application. I also have the original here with me, if you need to see it.

OFFICER: We can review the original later. After graduating, what did you do?

APPLICANT: I continued working in the service industry. I worked as a waiter, then a bartender. I was good at it. I enjoyed interacting with people.

OFFICER: Can you describe your political views or any political activities you were involved in while in Honduras?

APPLICANT: Yes. I started becoming politically active around 2016. I was very concerned about the corruption in the government and the lack of opportunities for young people. I began attending protests and rallies. I was very vocal about my opinions, mostly online, on social media.

OFFICER: Can you elaborate on the specific issues you were protesting?

APPLICANT: Mostly corruption. The government officials were stealing money, not investing in education or healthcare. The police were corrupt too, often working with gangs instead of protecting the people. There were also a lot of protests about the elections – many people believed they were rigged.

OFFICER: You mentioned being vocal online. Can you provide more details about that? What kind of posts were you making?

APPLICANT: I would share articles and news stories about corruption and injustice. I would also write my own opinions about the government and the need for change. I used a pseudonym at first, but eventually, I started using my real name. I felt it was important to be authentic.

OFFICER: Did you join any specific political organizations?

APPLICANT: No, I didn’t join any formal organization. I preferred to work independently and with smaller groups of activists. I felt like the larger organizations were often controlled by the same corrupt forces we were fighting against.

OFFICER: Let's move on to the incidents that led you to fear for your safety. Can you describe the first incident that made you feel threatened?

APPLICANT: It was in late 2019. I was at a protest against the government’s handling of a major scandal. The police started using tear gas and violence to disperse the crowd. I saw people getting beaten. I tried to help someone who had fallen, and then… then I was hit in the head with a baton.

OFFICER: Do you have any medical records related to that injury?

APPLICANT: No, I didn't go to the hospital. I was afraid to because I knew the police might be looking for protesters. A friend helped me clean the wound and took care of me.

OFFICER: Okay. And what happened after that? Did the police identify you?

APPLICANT: Not right away, but things started to change. I noticed people watching me. I received threatening messages on social media. They knew my name and where I worked.

OFFICER: Can you describe one of those threatening messages?

APPLICANT: One of them said, "We know who you are, Mateo. Stop causing trouble, or you will regret it." Another one said, "You're playing with fire, and you're going to get burned."

OFFICER: Did you report these threats to the police?

APPLICANT: No, absolutely not. The police were part of the problem. They were the ones sending the threats, or at least allowing them to happen. Reporting it would have been like reporting it to the people who were threatening me.

OFFICER: What was the most serious incident that made you decide to leave Honduras?

APPLICANT: It was in March of 2020. I was walking home from work late one night. Two men stopped me. They knew my name. They said I was a troublemaker and that I needed to learn a lesson. They beat me badly. They left me on the street.

OFFICER: Can you describe the men?

APPLICANT: They were wearing dark clothing, and their faces were partially covered. I couldn't identify them specifically, but they seemed… well-built, like they were used to fighting.

OFFICER: Did you recognize their voices?

APPLICANT: No, it was dark, and I was terrified. I couldn't really focus on their voices.

OFFICER: Did you report this incident to the police?

APPLICANT: Again, no. I was too afraid. I knew they wouldn't help me. I was lucky to be alive.

OFFICER: What did you do after the assault?

APPLICANT: I went to my mother's house. I told her what happened. She was terrified. She begged me to leave the country. She said it wasn't safe for me anymore.

OFFICER: Did you consider moving to another part of Honduras instead of leaving the country?

APPLICANT: Yes, we talked about it. But my mother and I realized that it wouldn't be safe anywhere in Honduras. The corruption and violence are everywhere. And they knew my name and face. It wouldn't take them long to find me.

OFFICER: And why do you believe these attacks were motivated by your political opinion?

APPLICANT: Because of the threats I received online and the things the men said to me during the assault. They specifically mentioned my activism and my criticism of the government. They called me a "troublemaker" and said I needed to learn a lesson. It was clear they were targeting me because of my political beliefs.

OFFICER: What evidence do you have to support your claim that you would be persecuted if you returned to Honduras?

APPLICANT: I have the social media posts, although some of them have been deleted now. I have photos of me at protests. I have witness statements from friends who can testify about my activism and the threats I received. My mother is also willing to provide a statement about the assault and her fear for my safety. I also submitted country condition reports that document the widespread corruption and violence in Honduras, particularly against political activists.

ATTORNEY: Officer Reynolds, we have also submitted reports from human rights organizations detailing the persecution of individuals expressing dissenting political views in Honduras.

OFFICER: Thank you, Ms. Alvarez. [Applicant's Name], can you describe your journey to the United States?

APPLICANT: I left Honduras a few days after the assault. I traveled through Guatemala and Mexico. It was a difficult and dangerous journey. I traveled with a group of other people who were also fleeing violence and persecution. We hired a coyote to help us cross the border into the United States.

OFFICER: When did you enter the United States?

APPLICANT: I entered in April of 2020.

OFFICER: And how did you enter?

APPLICANT: I crossed the border near Tijuana. I was apprehended by Border Patrol shortly after crossing.

OFFICER: What are your plans if you are granted asylum in the United States?

APPLICANT: I want to work and contribute to society. I have experience in the service industry, and I am a hard worker. I am also eager to learn new skills and improve my English. I would also like to continue advocating for human rights and democracy in Honduras, from a safe distance. I would also like to bring my mother and sister here, if possible. They are still in danger.

OFFICER: You mentioned wanting to improve your English. How did you learn English to the level you are at now?

APPLICANT: I started learning English in high school, but I really improved after graduation. I watched a lot of American movies and TV shows, and I practiced speaking with tourists who came to the restaurant where I worked. I also used online resources to learn grammar and vocabulary.

OFFICER: Are you currently employed?

APPLICANT: Yes, I am working as a busser in a restaurant. It's not my ideal job, but it's helping me to pay the bills and support myself.

OFFICER: Ms. Alvarez, do you have any questions for your client at this time?

ATTORNEY: Yes, just a few clarifying questions. [Applicant's Name], can you please describe in more detail the specific ways in which the Honduran government fails to protect its citizens from violence?

APPLICANT: The police are often corrupt and ineffective. They don't investigate crimes properly, and they often protect the perpetrators instead of the victims. The judicial system is also weak and easily influenced by powerful people. There is a culture of impunity, where criminals are rarely held accountable for their actions. And the gangs… they operate with near impunity, often with the tacit support of government officials.

ATTORNEY: Thank you. That’s all the questions I have for now.

OFFICER: [Applicant's Name], I have a few more questions for you. In your application, you mentioned that you identify as non-binary. Has your gender identity ever caused you any problems in Honduras?

APPLICANT: Yes, it has. While my asylum claim is based on my political opinion, my gender identity has made me more vulnerable. Honduras is a very conservative country, and there is a lot of discrimination against LGBTQ+ people. I have experienced verbal harassment and discrimination because of my gender expression. While it wasn't the primary reason I fled, it certainly contributed to my sense of vulnerability and fear.

OFFICER: Thank you for sharing that. I see here in your file that you submitted several news articles about political unrest in Honduras. Can you tell me how you selected these articles and why you believe they are relevant to your case?

APPLICANT: I selected those articles because they accurately depict the political climate in Honduras and the dangers faced by political activists. They show the corruption, the violence, and the government's crackdown on dissent. They are relevant because they corroborate my testimony and demonstrate that my fear of persecution is well-founded.

OFFICER: Okay. Thank you. I have no further questions at this time. [Applicant's Name], do you have anything else you would like to add?

APPLICANT: I just want to say that I am telling the truth. I am genuinely afraid to return to Honduras. I believe that my life would be in danger if I were forced to go back. I am asking for your protection.

OFFICER: Thank you. Ms. Alvarez, do you have any closing remarks?

ATTORNEY: Yes, Officer Reynolds. We believe that [Applicant's Name] has presented a credible and compelling case for asylum. He has demonstrated a well-founded fear of persecution based on his political opinion. He has provided supporting documentation and testimony that corroborates his claims. We respectfully request that his application for asylum be granted.

OFFICER: Thank you, Ms. Alvarez. This interview is now concluded. We will review your application and the information provided, and you will receive a decision in writing.
