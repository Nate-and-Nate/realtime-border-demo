INTERVIEW BEGINS

OFFICER: Good morning, Mr. Rodriguez. My name is Officer Miller, and I am an Asylum Officer with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Thank you for coming in today. I want to explain the purpose of this interview and the process we will follow. You filed an application for asylum, which means you are asking the United States to protect you from being returned to El Salvador because you fear persecution there. I want to assure you that I will listen carefully to your story. I need you to answer my questions truthfully and completely. Do you understand?

APPLICANT: Yes, Officer. I understand.

OFFICER: Before we begin, I need to swear you in. Please raise your right hand and repeat after me: Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

APPLICANT: I do.

OFFICER: Thank you. Please be seated. Let’s start with some background information. Can you please state your full name and date of birth for the record?

APPLICANT: My full name is Ricardo Antonio Rodriguez. My date of birth is June 12, 1965.

OFFICER: Mr. Rodriguez, can you please tell me about your educational background?

APPLICANT: I attended… uh… *Instituto Nacional de Santa Ana*. It is a secondary school. I finished there.

OFFICER: So you completed secondary education? Did you receive a diploma or certificate?

APPLICANT: Yes, a diploma. *Bachillerato*.

OFFICER: Okay. And after secondary school, did you pursue any further education or training?

APPLICANT: No, not formally. I joined the… the military. They provided… some training.

OFFICER: Can you elaborate on the training you received in the military? What kind of training was it, and for how long?

APPLICANT: It was… basic training, of course. Then… specialized training for my… my role. I was in… communications. Using radios, setting up… equipment. It lasted about six months, the specialized training.

OFFICER: And what rank did you achieve in the military?

APPLICANT: I… I rose to the rank of *Sargento Primero*. Sergeant First Class.

OFFICER: And how long were you in the military?

APPLICANT: Almost twenty years.

OFFICER: What were your responsibilities as a Sergeant First Class in communications? Be specific.

APPLICANT: I was responsible for maintaining the communications equipment for my unit. Making sure the radios worked, the antennas were properly set up. Sometimes, I had to train new recruits on how to use the equipment. I also… sometimes helped with intelligence gathering, listening to… transmissions.

OFFICER: You mentioned intelligence gathering. Can you elaborate on what kind of intelligence you were gathering and for what purpose?

APPLICANT: It was… mostly routine stuff. Monitoring communications from… suspected gang members. Trying to intercept their messages. It was… part of the military's effort to combat crime.

OFFICER: Thank you. Now, Mr. Rodriguez, you are seeking asylum based on your fear of persecution due to your sexual orientation. Can you tell me when you first realized you were gay?

APPLICANT: It was… gradual. I think I always knew, deep down. But I didn't… didn't acknowledge it to myself until… maybe my late twenties. It was difficult.

OFFICER: What made it difficult?

APPLICANT: The culture in El Salvador. Very… conservative. Machismo. It was not… acceptable to be gay. Especially not in the military.

OFFICER: Did you ever tell anyone in the military that you were gay?

APPLICANT: No! Never! It would have been… disastrous. I would have been… dishonorably discharged, at the very least. Maybe worse.

OFFICER: Did you experience any specific incidents of discrimination or harassment in the military because of your sexual orientation, even if no one knew you were gay? Perhaps jokes or derogatory comments?

APPLICANT: There were… always jokes. About… *maricones*. But they were… just jokes. I didn't think they… applied to me, because no one knew.

OFFICER: So, you are saying you were never personally targeted or harassed?

APPLICANT: Not… directly. Not that I’m aware of.

OFFICER: When did you leave the military?

APPLICANT: 2015. I retired.

OFFICER: And what did you do after you retired from the military?

APPLICANT: I… tried to start a small business. A… a repair shop. Fixing electronics. But it didn't… didn't work out.

OFFICER: Why didn't it work out?

APPLICANT: Not enough customers. Too much competition. And… I wasn't very good at the business side of things.

OFFICER: So, when did the incidents of persecution you are claiming in your asylum application begin? Be specific with dates and locations.

APPLICANT: It started… after I retired. Maybe… 2017? I met… someone. His name was… Carlos. We were… together.

OFFICER: How did you meet Carlos?

APPLICANT: Through… a friend. We started… dating.

OFFICER: Did people in your community know about your relationship with Carlos?

APPLICANT: I tried to keep it… secret. But… El Salvador is a small place. People talk.

OFFICER: What happened in 2017?

APPLICANT: I was… walking home one night. And… some men stopped me. They… they called me names. *Puto*. *Maricon*. They… they beat me.

OFFICER: Where did this happen?

APPLICANT: In… Santa Ana. Near my house. On Calle… *Avenida Independencia*.

OFFICER: Did you report this incident to the police?

APPLICANT: No.

OFFICER: Why not?

APPLICANT: What was the point? The police… they don't care about gay people. They would have… laughed at me. Maybe even… joined in.

OFFICER: Were you seriously injured? Did you require medical attention?

APPLICANT: I had… bruises. A… a cut on my face. I didn't go to the doctor.

OFFICER: Did anything else happen after that incident in 2017?

APPLICANT: Yes. There were… more incidents. Less… violent, but still… frightening. People would… shout things at me in the street. Throw things at my house. One time, someone… spray-painted graffiti on my door. Homophobic slurs.

OFFICER: Can you provide me with specific dates for these incidents, or at least a timeline?

APPLICANT: It was… sporadic. Maybe… once every few months. I don't remember the exact dates.

OFFICER: You stated you met Carlos in 2017. What happened to him?

APPLICANT: Carlos… he… he disappeared. In 2019.

OFFICER: Disappeared? Can you elaborate?

APPLICANT: He went to… visit his family in another town. And… he never came back. I… I don't know what happened to him.

OFFICER: Did you report his disappearance to the police?

APPLICANT: Yes. But they… they didn't do anything. They said he probably just… ran off with another woman. They didn't take it seriously.

OFFICER: Do you believe Carlos' disappearance was related to his sexual orientation?

APPLICANT: I… I don't know. It's possible. El Salvador is… a dangerous place.

OFFICER: You mentioned you tried to start a business after retiring from the military. Did you ever consider relocating to another part of El Salvador to avoid the persecution you were experiencing?

APPLICANT: I… I thought about it. But… where would I go? The whole country is… like that. And I didn't have… much money.

OFFICER: Did you ever seek help from any LGBTQ+ organizations in El Salvador?

APPLICANT: No. I was… afraid. I didn't want to… draw attention to myself.

OFFICER: Mr. Rodriguez, you served in the military for twenty years. You were a Sergeant First Class. You have training in communications and intelligence gathering. Why didn't you use your skills and training to protect yourself or investigate Carlos' disappearance?

APPLICANT: It's… different. The military is… one thing. Dealing with… criminals is another. I'm not… a detective. And I didn't want to… put myself in more danger.

OFFICER: When did you decide to come to the United States?

APPLICANT: After Carlos disappeared. I was… scared. I felt like I was… next.

OFFICER: How did you come to the United States?

APPLICANT: I flew. I had a… tourist visa.

OFFICER: When did you enter the United States?

APPLICANT: January 15, 2023.

OFFICER: And you filed your asylum application on February 10, 2023. What changed between January 15th and February 10th that made you decide you couldn't return to El Salvador?

APPLICANT: I… I saw news reports about… violence against gay people in El Salvador. It reminded me of… what happened to Carlos. I realized I couldn't… go back.

OFFICER: Mr. Rodriguez, you have stated that you have advanced English proficiency. Where did you learn to speak English so well?

APPLICANT: In… the military. We had to… learn some English. For… communications with… American counterparts. And I… watched a lot of movies.

OFFICER: You indicated on your application that you possess critical skills that could be valuable in the United States. Given your background in military communications, what kind of work do you envision yourself doing here?

APPLICANT: I could… work in telecommunications. Or… maybe in security. Using my… knowledge of communications equipment.

OFFICER: Do you have any family members in El Salvador who are at risk because of your sexual orientation or your departure?

APPLICANT: My… my mother. She is old. She doesn't know… about me. I worry about her.

OFFICER: Has she been threatened or harassed because of you?

APPLICANT: Not… that I know of. But… I worry.

OFFICER: What evidence do you have to support your claims of persecution?

APPLICANT: I have… some photos of the graffiti on my door. And… a copy of the police report about Carlos' disappearance. I submitted them with my application.

OFFICER: Mr. Rodriguez, I’ve reviewed the evidence you submitted. The photos of the graffiti are of poor quality and do not clearly show the slurs you claim were written. The police report regarding Carlos' disappearance simply states that he is missing and does not indicate any connection to anti-gay violence. Do you have any other evidence to corroborate your claims?

APPLICANT: No. That’s all I have.

OFFICER: Mr. Rodriguez, thank you for your testimony. I have a few follow-up questions. You stated you were a Sergeant First Class in the military, but you also said you were responsible for basic tasks like setting up antennas. That seems like a task typically assigned to lower-ranking soldiers. Can you explain this discrepancy?

APPLICANT: Well… sometimes… even senior soldiers have to do… basic tasks. It depends on the situation.

OFFICER: Also, you stated that you kept your sexual orientation a secret in the military, and yet you also said there were jokes about *maricones* that you didn't think applied to you. If you were trying to hide your sexual orientation, why wouldn't you be concerned about those jokes?

APPLICANT: I… I didn’t want to… seem too sensitive. I tried to… laugh along.

OFFICER: One last question. You stated that you saw news reports about violence against gay people in El Salvador that prompted you to apply for asylum. Can you provide me with specific details about these reports, such as the news outlets or the dates they were published?

APPLICANT: I… I don’t remember the specific details. I just remember… seeing them online.

OFFICER: Okay, Mr. Rodriguez. I have no further questions for you at this time. Do you have anything else you would like to add?

APPLICANT: No, Officer. Thank you for listening.

OFFICER: Thank you for your time. I will now suspend the interview. You will receive a written decision in the mail.
