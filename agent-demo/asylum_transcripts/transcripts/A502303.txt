INTERVIEW BEGINS

OFFICER: Good morning. My name is Officer Miller, and this is an interview concerning your application for asylum in the United States. Before we begin, I need to swear you in. Please raise your right hand. Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes, I swear.

OFFICER: Thank you. I am recording this interview. Please state your name and date of birth for the record.

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) My name is [Applicant's Full Name], and my date of birth is [Applicant's Date of Birth].

OFFICER: Thank you. And can you confirm that you do not have legal representation present today?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes, that is correct.

OFFICER: Okay. Let's start with some background information. Can you tell me about yourself, where you were born, and where you grew up in Iraq?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I was born and raised in Baghdad. I lived there my whole life until I came to the United States. Baghdad was… home. But it became too dangerous.

OFFICER: Can you describe your family situation growing up?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I lived with my parents and my younger sister. We were a close family. My father was a teacher, and my mother worked in a small shop selling clothes. They always wanted the best for us.

OFFICER: You indicated on your application that you identify as non-binary. Can you tell me when you first realized this?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) It was… I always felt different. Even as a child, I didn't fit into the roles that were expected of boys or girls. I preferred clothes and activities that were considered for both genders. As I got older, maybe around 16 or 17, I began to understand what it meant to be non-binary. The words weren't there, really, in Arabic the way they are in English, but the feeling was.

OFFICER: Did you express this identity openly in Iraq?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) (Hesitates) No. Never. Not really. Only to a very small number of very trusted friends. It was too dangerous. I had to hide who I truly was.

OFFICER: Let's talk about your education. I see you have a bachelor's degree. Can you tell me where you obtained it and what you studied?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes. I have a bachelor's degree from the University of Baghdad. I studied English Literature. I always loved reading and learning about different cultures.

OFFICER: Why English Literature specifically?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I found solace in the stories. They offered a world where things could be different, where people could be accepted for who they are. I dreamed of a world like that.

OFFICER: And what did you do after you graduated?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I worked in the service industry. I worked in several cafes and restaurants in Baghdad. Mostly as a waiter, sometimes helping with managing the front of the house.

OFFICER: Can you elaborate on your responsibilities and how you enjoyed the work?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) (Smiling slightly) I enjoyed meeting people. I liked making them feel comfortable and welcome. It was a way to connect with others, even if just for a short time. As a waiter, I took orders, served food, and ensured customers had a pleasant experience. Sometimes I dealt with complaints, but I always tried to resolve them fairly. When I helped manage, I would organize staff schedules, take inventory, and handle cash. It was hard work, but I felt useful.

OFFICER: Now, let's talk about the reasons you left Iraq. You mentioned it became too dangerous. Can you elaborate on that?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) (Voice trembling) It became dangerous because of who I am. Because I am different. Because I am non-binary.

OFFICER: Can you describe specific incidents of persecution or threats that you experienced?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) The first incident… it was about two years ago. I was walking home from work late one night. A group of men stopped me. They started shouting insults at me. They called me names, said I was an abomination, that I was bringing shame to my family and to Islam. They pushed me to the ground and kicked me. I was bruised and bleeding. I didn't report it to the police. I was too afraid. The police wouldn't have helped me; they might have joined in.

OFFICER: Do you know who these men were?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) No. I had never seen them before. They were just… men. Looking for someone to hurt.

OFFICER: And after that incident, did things get worse?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes. It became more frequent. People would stare, whisper, and sometimes shout things at me in the street. I started to avoid going out alone, especially at night. But it wasn't enough. Then, about a year ago, I was fired from my job.

OFFICER: Why were you fired?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) My boss said that some customers had complained about me. They said I was "unnatural" and made them uncomfortable. He said he couldn't afford to lose customers. He didn't say it directly, but I knew it was because of how I presented myself, because I was different.

OFFICER: Did you try to find another job?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I did. But it was difficult. Many places wouldn't even consider me. They would look at me strangely and say they weren't hiring, even when I knew they were. The word had spread.

OFFICER: Did you ever consider relocating within Iraq to a safer area?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I did. I thought about going to Erbil, in the Kurdistan region. I heard it was more tolerant. But I didn't have any family or friends there, and I didn't have any money. I was afraid I would just be trading one set of problems for another. And even there, it's not truly safe for LGBTQ+ people.

OFFICER: Did you ever consider seeking help from the authorities?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) (Shakes head) Never. The police are not there to protect people like me. They are often the ones who perpetrate the violence. There have been reports of police arresting and even torturing people for being LGBTQ+. I couldn't risk it.

OFFICER: Can you describe the circumstances surrounding your decision to leave Iraq?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) The final straw was when my apartment was vandalized. I came home one night to find my door kicked in. My belongings were scattered everywhere, and there were hateful messages spray-painted on the walls. Things like "Get out, faggot" and "We know who you are." I was terrified. I knew I couldn't stay there anymore. I feared for my life. I felt like I was being hunted.

OFFICER: Do you have any evidence of this vandalism?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I… I took some pictures with my phone before I left. I have them on a USB drive. I can show you.

OFFICER: Yes, please provide that to me. (Officer takes the USB drive and reviews the photos). These are quite disturbing. Thank you. Now, can you describe your journey to the United States?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I sold everything I owned to get enough money for a plane ticket. I flew from Baghdad to Istanbul, and then from Istanbul to Mexico City. From there, I traveled to the U.S. border and presented myself to immigration officials. I asked for asylum.

OFFICER: Why did you choose to come to the United States?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I heard that the United States was a place where people could be free, where they could be themselves without fear of persecution. I knew it wouldn't be easy, but I hoped I could find safety and a new life here.

OFFICER: Do you have any family members in the United States?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes, I do. My aunt, my mother's sister, is a U.S. citizen. She has lived here for over 20 years.

OFFICER: How often do you communicate with her?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) We talk on the phone or video call at least once a week. She knows everything that has happened to me. She has been very supportive.

OFFICER: And is she aware of your asylum application?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes, she is. She is willing to provide any support she can.

OFFICER: Has your aunt submitted an affidavit of support on your behalf?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes, she has. It should be included with my application.

OFFICER: I see it here. Thank you. Now, let’s talk about your family in Iraq. You indicated you have a sister. Is she aware of your sexual orientation?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) She suspects. I have never explicitly told her, because I was afraid of putting her at risk. But she is a kind and understanding person. I believe she would accept me. I'm worried for her safety too. If I am known to be seeking asylum based on my identity, that could put her in danger.

OFFICER: Do you believe your sister is in immediate danger in Iraq?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I fear that she is. The situation is becoming more and more dangerous for LGBTQ+ people. Anyone associated with me could be targeted.

OFFICER: If you were granted asylum, what are your plans for the future?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I want to work. I want to contribute to this country. I have skills in the service industry. I am a hard worker, and I am eager to learn. I would like to find a job in a restaurant or cafe. Eventually, I would like to go back to school and maybe study something related to literature or languages. I want to build a new life for myself, a life where I can be safe and free.

OFFICER: Do you think your English literature background could be helpful in finding employment?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) While my English isn’t very good now, I’m confident I can improve quickly. I already understand a lot. And having a background in literature helps with communication and understanding different cultures, which can be useful in many jobs.

OFFICER: Given your experience in the service industry, have you considered any specific types of establishments you would like to work in here?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I enjoyed working in cafes. The atmosphere is usually relaxed and welcoming. I also have experience in fine dining restaurants. I’m willing to work anywhere that will give me a chance.

OFFICER: Do you have any documents or evidence to support your work experience, such as letters of recommendation or pay stubs?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I have some documents, but they are mostly in Arabic. I have some old pay stubs and a letter from a previous employer. I can provide them to you.

OFFICER: Please do. We can have them translated. Now, why do you believe you cannot return to Iraq?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) (Begins to cry) I cannot go back. If I go back, I will be killed. I will be tortured. I will be forced to live a lie, to hide who I am. I cannot live like that anymore. I would rather die here than go back to that life.

OFFICER: (Pause) I understand. Thank you for sharing your story with me. Is there anything else you would like to add?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) (Sniffling) I just… I just want to be safe. I want to be able to live my life without fear. I hope you can help me.

OFFICER: Thank you. I have all the information I need for now. I will review your application and the evidence you have provided. You will receive a decision in the mail. Do you understand?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes, I understand. Thank you.

OFFICER: This concludes the interview.
