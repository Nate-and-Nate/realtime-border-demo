INTERVIEW BEGINS

OFFICER: Good morning. My name is Officer Miller, and I am an Asylum Officer with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Thank you for coming in today. I want to explain the purpose of this interview. You have applied for asylum in the United States. This interview is to give you the opportunity to present your case and for me to ask questions about your application, Form I-589. I need to inform you that you are under oath, and all statements you make during this interview must be truthful. Do you understand?

APPLICANT: Yes, I understand.

OFFICER: Please raise your right hand and repeat after me: "I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God."

APPLICANT: I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God.

OFFICER: Thank you. Please be seated. I have reviewed your application, but I need to hear the details from you directly. Let's start with some background information. Can you please state your full name for the record?

APPLICANT: My name is Valeriano Jose Rodriguez.

OFFICER: And your date of birth?

APPLICANT: November 12, 1964.

OFFICER: And your place of birth?

APPLICANT: Caracas, Venezuela.

OFFICER: You identify as non-binary. Is that correct?

APPLICANT: Yes, that is correct. My pronouns are they/them.

OFFICER: Thank you for clarifying. I'll do my best to use the correct pronouns. Now, let’s talk about your education. Your application indicates you have a Bachelor's degree. Can you tell me more about that?

APPLICANT: Yes, I have a Bachelor of Arts degree from the Universidad Central de Venezuela in Caracas. I majored in Art History and minored in Religious Studies.

OFFICER: And when did you receive that degree?

APPLICANT: In 1987.

OFFICER: Could you tell me about your professional background? Your application mentions arts and culture.

APPLICANT: After graduating, I worked as a curator at the Museo de Arte Contemporáneo in Caracas for about fifteen years. I curated exhibitions, managed collections, and wrote articles for their publications. Later, I became a freelance art critic and consultant, working with various galleries and private collectors.

OFFICER: So, focusing on the time leading up to your departure from Venezuela, what were you doing professionally?

APPLICANT: I was primarily working as a freelance art critic, writing for several online publications and occasionally contributing to newspapers. I also gave private lectures on art history and theory.

OFFICER: Why did you leave Venezuela, Mr. Rodriguez?

APPLICANT: Because I feared for my life. I was being persecuted because of my religious beliefs and, increasingly, because of my gender identity.

OFFICER: Can you elaborate on your religious beliefs?

APPLICANT: I practice a syncretic form of spirituality that blends elements of indigenous Venezuelan beliefs with aspects of Catholicism and other traditions. It's a very personal and private faith, but it's deeply important to me. I often incorporate these beliefs into my artwork and writings, and I participate in small, private ceremonies with a few close friends.

OFFICER: And how did this lead to persecution?

APPLICANT: It started subtly. In my writings, I often critiqued the growing influence of certain evangelical groups in Venezuela and their intolerance towards minority religions and LGBTQ+ individuals. These groups began to publicly denounce my work, accusing me of blasphemy and spreading "anti-Christian propaganda." At first, it was just online harassment, but then it escalated.

OFFICER: Can you give me specific examples?

APPLICANT: Yes. In 2019, I wrote an article criticizing the destruction of indigenous sacred sites by mining companies, arguing that these sites were integral to the spiritual well-being of the Venezuelan people. A few days after the article was published, my apartment was vandalized. Someone spray-painted religious slurs on my door and left a threatening note.

OFFICER: Do you have that note?

APPLICANT: No, I didn't keep it. I was too scared. I just cleaned it up and tried to forget about it.

OFFICER: Did you report this incident to the police?

APPLICANT: No. The police in Venezuela are… unreliable. They are often complicit with these groups, or simply unwilling to help. Reporting it would have likely made things worse. I've heard stories, you know? They wouldn't take me seriously.

OFFICER: What happened next?

APPLICANT: The harassment continued online, becoming more intense and personal. They started targeting me specifically, mentioning my gender identity and using derogatory terms. They also started spreading rumors about my involvement in "cult activities" and accusing me of being a danger to society.

OFFICER: Did these threats extend beyond the online sphere?

APPLICANT: Yes. In early 2020, I was invited to give a lecture at a small cultural center in Caracas. A few days before the lecture, the center received a series of threatening phone calls, warning them to cancel my appearance. They eventually did cancel, citing "security concerns." I lost the income from that lecture.

OFFICER: And did you experience any physical harm?

APPLICANT: Yes. In March of 2020, I was walking home from a friend's house when I was attacked. A group of men ambushed me, shouting religious slurs and insults about my gender. They beat me badly, leaving me with bruises and a broken rib.

OFFICER: Do you have any medical records related to that incident?

APPLICANT: I do. I submitted them with my application. They are from a private clinic. I didn't go to a public hospital because I was afraid of being identified and further targeted.

OFFICER: I see the records here. Thank you. Did you report this attack to the police?

APPLICANT: Again, no. I was terrified. I knew that reporting it would only put me at greater risk. Instead, I tried to lay low for a while, hoping that the attention would die down.

OFFICER: Did it?

APPLICANT: No. In the summer of 2020, things got even worse. I was followed on several occasions. I started receiving phone calls with no one on the other end, just heavy breathing. And then, in August, my friend, Ricardo, who shared similar religious beliefs, was attacked.

OFFICER: What happened to Ricardo?

APPLICANT: He was severely beaten, and his apartment was ransacked. They destroyed his religious artifacts and left a message threatening me by name. That's when I knew I had to leave the country.

OFFICER: Do you know who attacked Ricardo?

APPLICANT: No, but I suspect it was the same group that had been harassing me. They knew about our shared beliefs, and the message they left made it clear that I was their next target.

OFFICER: Before leaving Venezuela, did you try to relocate within the country or seek protection from the authorities in a different city?

APPLICANT: I considered it, but I honestly didn't see any safe options. The evangelical groups have a strong presence throughout the country, and the government is either unwilling or unable to protect vulnerable populations like myself. Moving to another city would have only delayed the inevitable. Plus, my family…they couldn’t help. They're very traditional Catholics and disapproved of my…lifestyle.

OFFICER: Why can't you return to Venezuela?

APPLICANT: Because I am certain that I will be persecuted, possibly even killed. The groups that targeted me are still active, and the situation in Venezuela has only deteriorated since I left. The government is increasingly authoritarian, and there is no rule of law. I would have no protection. Also, the economic situation is dire. As an artist and critic, I would have no way to support myself.

OFFICER: You mentioned submitting supporting evidence with your application. Can you tell me what you included?

APPLICANT: Yes. I included copies of my articles, documenting my criticisms of the evangelical groups and the government. I also included the medical records from the attack in March 2020, as well as screenshots of the online harassment and threats I received. I also submitted news articles about the growing influence of evangelical groups in Venezuela and their persecution of religious minorities and LGBTQ+ individuals. And a sworn affidavit from Ricardo describing the attack on him and the threat made against me.

OFFICER: Let's talk about your family situation. You stated that you have no dependent family members on your application. Do you have any family in Venezuela?

APPLICANT: Yes, I have siblings and some cousins still in Venezuela.

OFFICER: Are they at risk because of your application for asylum?

APPLICANT: I hope not, but I fear they might be. The government is known to retaliate against the families of dissidents. I haven't been in contact with them since I left, to protect them. It is a very difficult decision, but I believe it is the best way to keep them safe.

OFFICER: Let's discuss your travel to the United States. Can you describe your route and timeline?

APPLICANT: I left Venezuela in September 2020. I flew to Colombia and then to Mexico. I stayed in Mexico City for a few weeks, trying to figure out my next steps. I then crossed the border into the United States in October 2020 with a valid tourist visa.

OFFICER: You entered the US on a tourist visa. What was your intention when you applied for and received that visa?

APPLICANT: At the time, I was still hoping that the situation in Venezuela would improve. I obtained the visa with the intention of visiting the US as a tourist. However, after the attack on Ricardo, I realized that I had no choice but to seek asylum here.

OFFICER: What are your plans if you are granted asylum in the United States?

APPLICANT: I want to rebuild my life here. I want to continue my work as an art critic and curator. I believe my skills and experience would be valuable to the arts community in the United States. I would also like to become involved in advocacy for human rights and religious freedom, particularly in Venezuela. I also hope to learn more about art therapy and potentially work with other asylum seekers. I believe that my own experiences with trauma can help me connect with and support others who have suffered similar hardships.

OFFICER: Your application notes that you have a strong command of English. How did you learn?

APPLICANT: I studied English in school in Venezuela. I also took private lessons. And I've been using it professionally for years, reading and writing about art from around the world.

OFFICER: One final question. In your application, you mention a particular incident where a local priest denounced you from the pulpit. Can you elaborate on that?

APPLICANT: Yes. This was in early 2019. I had written an article criticizing the Church's stance on LGBTQ+ rights. A few weeks later, the priest at my local church publicly denounced me during a sermon, calling me a "degenerate" and a "danger to the community." This led to increased harassment and ostracization from some members of my community. It felt like the walls were closing in.

OFFICER: Thank you, Mr. Rodriguez. I have no further questions at this time. Do you have anything else you would like to add?

APPLICANT: Yes. I just want to reiterate how much I fear for my life if I am forced to return to Venezuela. I have lost everything because of my beliefs, and I am desperate for a chance to rebuild my life in safety. I am not asking for much, just the opportunity to live in peace and freedom.

OFFICER: Thank you. I will now review your application and the information you have provided today. You will receive a written notification of the decision in the mail. Please make sure that you keep your address updated with USCIS.
