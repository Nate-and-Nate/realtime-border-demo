INTERVIEW BEGINS

OFFICER: Good morning, Ms. Petrova. My name is Officer Miller, and I am an asylum officer with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. I will be conducting your asylum interview today. Please raise your right hand and repeat after me: "I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God."

APPLICANT: I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God.

OFFICER: Thank you. Before we begin, I want to explain the process. You have filed an application for asylum, which means you are asking the United States government to protect you from being returned to Russia. I will ask you questions about your background, your reasons for leaving Russia, and your fears about returning. Please answer my questions honestly and completely. You have the right to seek legal counsel at your own expense, but you have chosen to proceed without an attorney today. Do you understand?

APPLICANT: Yes, I understand.

OFFICER: Okay. Let’s start with some basic background information. Please state your full name and date of birth for the record.

APPLICANT: My full name is Irina Alexeevna Petrova. My date of birth is March 12, 1985.

OFFICER: And what is your current address in the United States?

APPLICANT: 14 Oak Street, Apartment 2B, Anytown, USA.

OFFICER: Thank you. Your application states you are a citizen of Russia. Can you please describe where in Russia you were born and raised?

APPLICANT: I was born and raised in a small town called Sergiev Posad, near Moscow.

OFFICER: Okay. Now, let's talk about your education. Your application indicates you have no formal education. Can you elaborate on that?

APPLICANT: Yes. I... I didn't attend a traditional school. My family, they... were Old Believers. We believe in home-schooling, learning from family members. My grandmother taught me to read and write, and about Russian history and literature. My mother taught me domestic skills.

OFFICER: So, you never attended any type of schooling, public or private?

APPLICANT: No, never. Just my family's teachings.

OFFICER: Your application also states your profession is in education. How did you become involved in education without formal schooling?

APPLICANT: After my grandmother passed away, I felt a strong need to share the knowledge she gave me. I started informally teaching children in my community, other families who were also Old Believers. I would read to them, tell them stories, teach them basic literacy and arithmetic. It wasn't a formal job, just a way to help. Then, I started tutoring individual children, mostly focusing on Russian language and literature. Word of mouth spread, and more parents sought me out. I was being paid by the parents directly.

OFFICER: So, you were essentially a private tutor.

APPLICANT: Yes, exactly.

OFFICER: Okay. Now, let's move on to the reasons you left Russia and are seeking asylum here in the United States. Your application states that you fear persecution based on your sexual orientation. Can you please tell me about that?

APPLICANT: Yes. I am… I am a lesbian. And being gay in Russia is… very dangerous. The government, the people… they don’t accept it.

OFFICER: When did you first realize that you were attracted to women?

APPLICANT: I think… I always knew, deep down. But I didn’t really understand it until I was older, maybe around 20. I met a woman named Elena. We became very close friends, and then… it became more than friendship.

OFFICER: Can you describe your relationship with Elena?

APPLICANT: We were together for about five years. We lived together in a small apartment in Sergiev Posad. We tried to be discreet, but… in a small town, people talk.

OFFICER: Did you experience any specific incidents of discrimination or harassment during that time?

APPLICANT: Yes. Several times. People would stare at us, whisper things. Once, someone threw a rock through our window with a note that said “Get out, faggots.” It was terrifying.

OFFICER: Did you report this to the police?

APPLICANT: No. Absolutely not. The police in Russia… they are not there to help LGBT people. They are often part of the problem. Elena knew someone who had reported a similar incident, and the police did nothing. They even made things worse, telling her she should be ashamed of herself.

OFFICER: Can you describe any other incidents?

APPLICANT: Yes. There was one time when we were walking in the park, holding hands. A group of men started shouting at us, calling us names. They followed us for several blocks, threatening us. We were so scared we ran all the way home.

OFFICER: Were you physically harmed in any of these incidents?

APPLICANT: No, not physically harmed, but the fear… it was constant. We were always afraid of being discovered, of being attacked.

OFFICER: Did you ever experience any difficulties in your profession as a tutor because of your sexual orientation?

APPLICANT: Yes. After a while, some parents started pulling their children from my tutoring. They said they didn’t want their children being taught by “someone like me.” It was very hurtful. My income decreased significantly, and I struggled to make ends meet.

OFFICER: When did you decide to leave Russia?

APPLICANT: The situation became much worse after the new laws against “propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations” were passed. It felt like the government was actively encouraging hate against LGBT people. Elena and I started talking about leaving, about finding a place where we could be safe and free.

OFFICER: What specific event or incident led you to finally leave Russia?

APPLICANT: The turning point was when Elena was attacked. One evening, she was walking home from work when a group of men jumped her. They beat her badly, shouting homophobic slurs. She was hospitalized for several days.

OFFICER: Did you report this attack to the police?

APPLICANT: No. Again, we were too afraid. We knew they wouldn’t help us. We decided that we couldn’t stay in Russia any longer. It was too dangerous.

OFFICER: Do you have any medical records or other documentation related to Elena's attack?

APPLICANT: No. We didn't go to the police, and Elena was afraid to seek extensive medical treatment because she didn't want to draw attention to herself. The hospital visit was kept as short as possible. We were afraid that if the authorities found out, they would make things even worse.

OFFICER: What happened to Elena? Is she with you here in the United States?

APPLICANT: No. Elena… she couldn’t get a visa. She is still in Russia. That is why I am so worried. I am trying to find a way to bring her here, but it is very difficult.

OFFICER: So, you left Russia alone?

APPLICANT: Yes.

OFFICER: When did you leave Russia, and how did you travel to the United States?

APPLICANT: I left Russia on July 15, 2024. I flew from Moscow to Mexico City, then traveled by bus to the US border. I entered the United States on July 22, 2024, and presented myself to immigration officials at the border and requested asylum.

OFFICER: Did you have a visa to enter Mexico?

APPLICANT: Yes, I obtained a tourist visa.

OFFICER: Did you consider relocating to another part of Russia before leaving the country?

APPLICANT: We thought about it, but… we didn’t think it would be safe. Even in bigger cities like Moscow or St. Petersburg, there is still a lot of prejudice and violence against LGBT people. Plus, the laws are the same everywhere in Russia. There is no place where we could truly be safe.

OFFICER: Why do you believe you cannot return to Russia?

APPLICANT: Because I am afraid. I am afraid of being persecuted, of being attacked, of being killed. I am afraid for Elena’s safety. If I am deported back to Russia, I don’t know what will happen to me. I would have to hide who I am, live in constant fear. And I don’t want to live like that anymore.

OFFICER: What kind of evidence have you submitted to support your asylum claim?

APPLICANT: I submitted copies of news articles about the persecution of LGBT people in Russia, reports from human rights organizations, and personal photos of me and Elena together. I also submitted an affidavit from a friend who knows about my situation and can attest to the difficulties I faced in Russia.

OFFICER: Are your parents still living in Russia?

APPLICANT: Yes. They are.

OFFICER: Do they know about your sexual orientation?

APPLICANT: No. I have never told them. They are very traditional, very religious. I am afraid of how they would react. I don’t want to hurt them.

OFFICER: Are they aware that you have applied for asylum in the United States?

APPLICANT: No. I haven't told them that either.

OFFICER: What are your plans if you are granted asylum in the United States?

APPLICANT: I want to work, to contribute to society. I would like to continue teaching, maybe work with children who need extra help. I also want to become an advocate for LGBT rights, to help other people who are facing discrimination and persecution. I also want to find a way to bring Elena here so we can finally be safe and together.

OFFICER: Given that you don't have formal educational credentials, how do you plan to continue your tutoring work here in the United States?

APPLICANT: I understand that it might be difficult without formal qualifications. I am willing to take courses, to get certified, to do whatever it takes to improve my skills and become a qualified teacher. I am a hard worker, and I am willing to learn. I also have experience. I have been teaching for many years, and I am good at it.

OFFICER: Do you have any specific plans for how you will support yourself financially while you are pursuing further education or certification?

APPLICANT: I am currently working part-time as a housekeeper. It’s not ideal, but it helps me pay the bills. I am also looking for other opportunities. I am willing to do any kind of work to support myself. I am also saving money so that I can afford to take classes when I have the opportunity.

OFFICER: Ms. Petrova, I am noting in your file that you stated your parents were Old Believers, and you were homeschooled. However, you seem to speak very fluent English. Can you explain how you learned English?

APPLICANT: (Hesitates) Ah, yes. Well, after my grandmother passed, I started to… explore the world a bit more, you know? I was curious. I found some online resources to learn English. I watched movies and listened to music. I practiced with some people online. It took a lot of time and effort, but I was determined to learn.

OFFICER: You said you explored the world a bit more, but also that you lived with Elena in the same small town, and were afraid to even report a violent crime to the police. Can you help me understand this apparent contradiction?

APPLICANT: (Looks down, fidgets) It's... it's complicated. I was still afraid, still cautious. But I also wanted to learn, to grow. Learning English was a way for me to connect with the outside world, even if I couldn't physically leave. It was a way to feel less trapped. It gave me hope for a better future.

OFFICER: Okay. Thank you for clarifying. I have no further questions for you at this time. Please let me review my notes. One moment. (Officer pauses, reviewing notes). Ms. Petrova, based on this interview and the evidence you have presented, I am unable to make a decision on your asylum application today. Your case will be referred to the Immigration Court for further review. You will receive a notice in the mail with the date and time of your hearing. It is important that you attend this hearing. Do you understand?

APPLICANT: Yes, I understand. Thank you.

OFFICER: Do you have any questions for me?

APPLICANT: No, I don’t think so. Thank you for your time.
