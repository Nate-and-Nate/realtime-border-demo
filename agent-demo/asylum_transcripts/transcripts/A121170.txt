OFFICER: Thank you, Alex. I understand you are seeking asylum in the United States based on a fear of persecution in Ukraine. Before we begin, I need to advise you of the following: the information you provide during this interview will be used to determine if you qualify for asylum. It is important that you answer all my questions honestly and completely. Do you understand?

APPLICANT: (In Ukrainian, then translated) I was born August 15, 1998, in Kyiv.

OFFICER: And what is your gender identity?

APPLICANT: (In Ukrainian, then translated) I am non-binary.

OFFICER: Okay. Now, let's talk about your education. You indicated on your application that you have a Bachelor's degree. Can you tell me what you studied, where you studied, and when you graduated?

APPLICANT: (In Ukrainian, then translated) I studied Fine Arts at the Kyiv National University of Culture and Arts. I graduated in 2020.

OFFICER: Fine Arts. What kind of art did you focus on?

APPLICANT: (In Ukrainian, then translated) Mostly painting and sculpture. I also did some performance art.

OFFICER: Performance art? Can you elaborate on that? What kind of performances?

APPLICANT: (In Ukrainian, then translated) (Hesitates) Uh… different things. Sometimes political, sometimes… about identity.

OFFICER: Can you give me a specific example of a performance you did that was political or about identity?

APPLICANT: (In Ukrainian, then translated) (Long pause) There was one… about the war in Donbas. It was… a protest.

OFFICER: A protest? Where did this protest take place? And when?

APPLICANT: (In Ukrainian, then translated) It was in 2019. In Kyiv. At the Maidan.

OFFICER: And what exactly did you do during this performance protest?

APPLICANT: (In Ukrainian, then translated) I… I poured fake blood on myself. And… and shouted slogans.

OFFICER: What slogans did you shout?

APPLICANT: (In Ukrainian, then translated) (Hesitates again) Slogans against the war… for peace.

OFFICER: Did you have any problems with the authorities after this performance?

APPLICANT: (In Ukrainian, then translated) No.

OFFICER: Okay. So, after you graduated in 2020, what did you do professionally?

APPLICANT: (In Ukrainian, then translated) I worked as… a freelance artist. I sold paintings, did some commissions.

OFFICER: Can you provide any documentation to support this? Tax records, invoices, anything like that?

APPLICANT: (In Ukrainian, then translated) I… I don't have them with me. I left everything behind when I fled.

OFFICER: Okay. Let's move on to the reasons you left Ukraine. You are claiming persecution based on your non-binary identity. Can you describe how you were persecuted in Ukraine?

APPLICANT: (In Ukrainian, then translated) It started with… discrimination. People would stare, make comments. Sometimes… they would yell things at me in the street.

OFFICER: Can you give me specific examples of what people would say or do?

APPLICANT: (In Ukrainian, then translated) They would call me names… like “faggot,” “degenerate.” They would tell me to go back to where I came from… even though I was born in Kyiv.

OFFICER: Did you report these incidents to the police?

APPLICANT: (In Ukrainian, then translated) No. What would they do? They wouldn’t care.

OFFICER: Why do you say that?

APPLICANT: (In Ukrainian, then translated) Because the police… they are also… against people like me.

OFFICER: Do you have any evidence to support that claim? Reports from human rights organizations, news articles, anything like that?

APPLICANT: (In Ukrainian, then translated) No, but everyone knows it.

OFFICER: Okay. You also mentioned in your application that you cooperated with allied forces. Can you elaborate on that?

APPLICANT: (In Ukrainian, then translated) Yes. After the war started… I helped. I… I translated documents. For… for some foreign journalists.

OFFICER: What kind of documents? And for which journalists?

APPLICANT: (In Ukrainian, then translated) Documents about… the war. About the Russian aggression. I don’t remember the names of the journalists.

OFFICER: Do you have any proof of this cooperation? Any emails, letters of recommendation, anything at all?

APPLICANT: (In Ukrainian, then translated) No. It was all… very secret.

OFFICER: Okay. Now, you said the discrimination started with comments and stares. Did it escalate beyond that? Did you experience any physical violence?

APPLICANT: (In Ukrainian, then translated) (Long pause) Yes. Once… I was attacked.

OFFICER: Can you describe the attack? When did it happen, where did it happen, and who attacked you?

APPLICANT: (In Ukrainian, then translated) It was… in July of 2023. In Kyiv. Near my apartment. Two men… they beat me.

OFFICER: Why do you think they attacked you?

APPLICANT: (In Ukrainian, then translated) Because of how I look. Because I am… different.

OFFICER: Did they say anything to you during the attack?

APPLICANT: (In Ukrainian, then translated) Yes. They called me names. They said I was… an abomination.

OFFICER: Did you report this attack to the police?

APPLICANT: (In Ukrainian, then translated) No.

OFFICER: Why not? You said you were attacked near your apartment. Wouldn’t you want to report such a serious crime?

APPLICANT: (In Ukrainian, then translated) (Hesitates) I was afraid. I didn't think they would help.

OFFICER: Did you seek medical attention after the attack?

APPLICANT: (In Ukrainian, then translated) No.

OFFICER: Why not?

APPLICANT: (In Ukrainian, then translated) I… I didn't have any money.

OFFICER: Okay. Let’s talk about your departure from Ukraine. What route did you take to get to the United States?

APPLICANT: (In Ukrainian, then translated) I flew from Kyiv to… to Warsaw. Then to… Mexico City. And then I crossed the border.

OFFICER: When did you enter the United States?

APPLICANT: (In Ukrainian, then translated) November 10th, 2024.

OFFICER: And you entered without authorization?

APPLICANT: (In Ukrainian, then translated) Yes.

OFFICER: Why didn’t you try to come to the United States legally, with a visa?

APPLICANT: (In Ukrainian, then translated) I didn't have time. I was afraid.

OFFICER: Let's go back to your claim about helping foreign journalists. Can you describe the circumstances of how you met these journalists and the type of work you performed for them?

APPLICANT: (In Ukrainian, then translated) (Again, a long pause) I met them… online. Through a… a forum. They needed someone who spoke Ukrainian and English. I… I translated articles.

OFFICER: You indicated on your application that you have no English proficiency. How were you able to translate for these journalists?

APPLICANT: (In Ukrainian, then translated) (Visibly nervous) Oh. I… I meant… I used online translation tools.

OFFICER: So, you weren’t actually translating yourself? You were using Google Translate or something similar?

APPLICANT: (In Ukrainian, then translated) Yes.

OFFICER: Ms. Chen, do you have anything you'd like to add at this time?

ATTORNEY: Officer, I would like to remind you that my client has experienced significant trauma. It can be difficult to recall specific details under such circumstances.

OFFICER: I understand, Ms. Chen. (To applicant) Alex, you mentioned earlier that you sold paintings and did commissions. Can you describe your artistic style? What kind of subjects did you typically paint?

APPLICANT: (In Ukrainian, then translated) I like to paint… portraits. And landscapes.

OFFICER: Where did you sell your paintings? Did you have a gallery?

APPLICANT: (In Ukrainian, then translated) No. I sold them… online. And at… at markets.

OFFICER: Where is your sister now?

APPLICANT: (In Ukrainian, then translated) She is still in Ukraine.

OFFICER: Is she also non-binary?

APPLICANT: (In Ukrainian, then translated) No.

OFFICER: Why couldn’t she come with you?

APPLICANT: (In Ukrainian, then translated) She… she has to take care of our mother.

OFFICER: Is your mother also in Ukraine?

APPLICANT: (In Ukrainian, then translated) Yes.

OFFICER: Why are you unable to return to Ukraine?

APPLICANT: (In Ukrainian, then translated) Because… I am afraid. I will be persecuted. I will be attacked again.

OFFICER: Do you believe that the Ukrainian government is unable or unwilling to protect you from this persecution?

APPLICANT: (In Ukrainian, then translated) Yes. They don’t care about people like me.

OFFICER: What are your plans if you are granted asylum here in the United States?

APPLICANT: (In Ukrainian, then translated) I want to… to work. To make art.

OFFICER: Do you have any specific ideas about how you would use your artistic skills here?

APPLICANT: (In Ukrainian, then translated) Maybe… I can teach art. Or… sell my paintings.

OFFICER: Alex, do you have anything else you would like to add?

APPLICANT: (In Ukrainian, then translated) No.

OFFICER: Ms. Chen, anything further from you?
