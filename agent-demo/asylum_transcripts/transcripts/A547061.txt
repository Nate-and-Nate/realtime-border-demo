INTERVIEW BEGINS

OFFICER: Good morning, Ms. Elena Rodriguez. My name is Officer Miller, and this is an interview regarding your application for asylum in the United States. I need to inform you that I am a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services officer, and I have the authority to make a recommendation on your application. Everything you say here today will be under oath, so please answer truthfully. I also want to let you know that you are not required to answer any question that you feel might incriminate you. However, refusing to answer questions may have a negative impact on your case. Do you understand?

APPLICANT: Yes, Officer Miller, I understand.

OFFICER: Please raise your right hand and repeat after me: "I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God."

APPLICANT: I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God.

OFFICER: Thank you. Please be seated.

APPLICANT: Thank you.

OFFICER: Before we begin, can you confirm your name, date of birth, and current address for the record?

APPLICANT: Yes. My name is Elena Maria Rodriguez, my date of birth is July 12, 1976, and my current address is 45 Oak Street, Apartment 2B, Anytown, USA.

OFFICER: Thank you. Ms. Rodriguez, your application is based on your fear of persecution in Honduras due to your religious beliefs. Is that correct?

APPLICANT: Yes, that is correct.

OFFICER: Let's start with your background. Can you tell me a little about your life in Honduras before you came to the United States?

APPLICANT: Of course. I was born and raised in Tegucigalpa. I come from a family of five – my parents, two brothers, and myself. I attended private Catholic schools throughout my childhood and adolescence. After high school, I attended the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de Honduras, where I earned a Bachelor's degree in Finance.

OFFICER: Can you tell me more about your religious beliefs and practices?

APPLICANT: I was raised Catholic, as I mentioned, but about ten years ago, I began to question some of the Church’s teachings. I started exploring other Christian denominations and found myself drawn to a small, evangelical church that emphasized personal interpretation of the Bible and a more direct relationship with God. It was called "La Luz Verdadera" – The True Light.

OFFICER: When did you begin attending this church?

APPLICANT: Approximately 2014.

OFFICER: Were your family and friends aware of your change in religious beliefs?

APPLICANT: Yes, they were. My parents were disappointed. They are devout Catholics and saw my new faith as a betrayal. My brothers were less concerned, but they still didn't understand it. Many of my Catholic friends distanced themselves from me.

OFFICER: Did you experience any problems because of your new faith at that time?

APPLICANT: Not immediately. There were some awkward conversations and strained relationships, but nothing truly threatening. The real problems started around 2018.

OFFICER: Can you describe what happened in 2018?

APPLICANT: In 2018, the political climate in Honduras became increasingly polarized. The government, which had strong ties to the Catholic Church, began to crack down on dissenting voices, including religious minorities. La Luz Verdadera was seen as a threat because we were critical of the government's corruption and social policies.

OFFICER: Can you give me specific examples of this crackdown and how it affected you personally?

APPLICANT: Yes. In July of 2018, our church was vandalized. Someone threw rocks through the windows and spray-painted anti-evangelical slogans on the walls. The police were called, but they did very little. The officer who responded seemed indifferent, almost dismissive. He said it was probably just kids causing trouble.

OFFICER: Did this happen only once?

APPLICANT: No, it happened several times over the next few months. Each time, we reported it to the police, but they never investigated properly. Then, in October 2018, things escalated.

OFFICER: How so?

APPLICANT: One evening, after a church service, I was walking home with two other members of the congregation, Maria and Carlos. We were ambushed by a group of men. They shouted insults at us, calling us "heretics" and "traitors." They physically attacked us.

OFFICER: Can you describe the attack in more detail?

APPLICANT: They pushed us to the ground and started kicking us. I was kicked in the stomach and head. Maria was punched in the face, and Carlos was hit with a metal pipe. We were all badly bruised and shaken.

OFFICER: Did you report this attack to the police?

APPLICANT: Yes, we did. We went to the police station the next day and filed a report. We even provided descriptions of the attackers. But again, the police did nothing. They said they would investigate, but we never heard back from them. We felt completely unprotected. I have a copy of the police report in my supporting documents.

OFFICER: I see that. Thank you. Did the attacks continue after that?

APPLICANT: Yes, they did. They became more frequent and more violent. We started receiving threatening phone calls at home. The callers would say things like, "Leave the church, or you'll regret it," and "We know where you live."

OFFICER: Did you recognize any of the voices?

APPLICANT: No, they were always distorted or muffled. I suspected it was the same group of men who attacked us. I was living in constant fear.

OFFICER: Did you consider moving to another part of Honduras to escape the persecution?

APPLICANT: Yes, I did. I considered moving to San Pedro Sula, where my brother lives. But I was afraid that the same people would find me there. Also, my brother told me that the situation in San Pedro Sula was even worse than in Tegucigalpa, with widespread gang violence and corruption. I didn't feel safe anywhere in Honduras.

OFFICER: Why didn’t you seek help from the authorities beyond reporting to the police? Did you try to contact any human rights organizations?

APPLICANT: I did, eventually. After several incidents where the police dismissed my reports, I contacted a human rights organization called "Defensores de la Fe" – Defenders of the Faith. They documented my case and provided some legal advice. They advised me to seek asylum in another country, as they believed my life was in danger in Honduras. They told me the corruption was too deep, and the police were either unwilling or unable to protect me. They are the ones who suggested asylum in the United States was my best option. I have a letter from Defensores de la Fe in my supporting documents.

OFFICER: I see that. Thank you. What were you doing professionally in Honduras before you left?

APPLICANT: I worked as a financial analyst for a large insurance company. I had been with the company for over ten years and had worked my way up to a senior position. I enjoyed my work, and I was good at it. I have included my professional resume and letters of recommendation from my former employer.

OFFICER: Your educational background and professional experience appear to be quite strong. How did you obtain your Bachelor's degree, and what were your primary responsibilities as a financial analyst?

APPLICANT: I earned my Bachelor's degree through four years of full-time study at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de Honduras. It was a very competitive program, and I worked very hard to succeed. As a financial analyst, my responsibilities included analyzing financial data, preparing financial reports, and providing investment recommendations to clients. I also managed a portfolio of investments for the company.

OFFICER: You mentioned you were fluent in English. How did you learn English?

APPLICANT: I started learning English in elementary school, but I really improved my skills through private tutoring and online courses. Also, my job required me to communicate with international clients, so I had plenty of opportunities to practice my English.

OFFICER: Why did you decide to come to the United States?

APPLICANT: I came to the United States because I believed it was the only place where I could be safe and practice my religion freely. I knew that the United States had a strong tradition of religious freedom and that it offered protection to people who were being persecuted in their home countries.

OFFICER: Can you describe your journey to the United States?

APPLICANT: I flew from Tegucigalpa to Mexico City. From there, I traveled by bus to Tijuana. I then crossed the border into the United States with the help of a coyote.

OFFICER: When did you enter the United States?

APPLICANT: I entered the United States on January 15, 2024.

OFFICER: What has your experience been like in the United States so far?

APPLICANT: It has been a relief, honestly. I feel safe here. I have been attending a similar evangelical church in Anytown, and the community has been very welcoming. I am working part-time as a bookkeeper to support myself while my asylum case is pending.

OFFICER: Do you have any family members who are also at risk in Honduras?

APPLICANT: Yes, my parents and brothers are still there. While they are not members of La Luz Verdadera, I worry that they could be targeted because of their association with me. The government has been known to punish families of dissidents. I am very concerned for their safety.

OFFICER: What are your plans if you are granted asylum in the United States?

APPLICANT: If I am granted asylum, I plan to continue working hard to build a new life here. I want to use my skills and experience to contribute to American society. I would like to find a full-time job as a financial analyst. I also want to become involved in my church community and help other refugees who are seeking safety in the United States. I also hope to one day be able to bring my family here so they can be safe too.

OFFICER: Ms. Rodriguez, you have provided quite a bit of information today. I want to give you an opportunity to add anything else that you think is important for me to consider in your case. Is there anything else you would like to tell me?

APPLICANT: Yes, Officer. I just want to reiterate that I am genuinely afraid to return to Honduras. The persecution I experienced there was real, and I believe that my life would be in danger if I were forced to go back. I am seeking asylum in the United States because I believe it is the only place where I can be safe and live my life in peace. I am grateful for the opportunity to be here, and I am committed to contributing to this country if I am granted asylum. I also want to add that I have always been a law-abiding citizen, both in Honduras and in the United States. I believe in the rule of law, and I am committed to upholding the laws of this country.

OFFICER: Thank you, Ms. Rodriguez. I have reviewed the documents you submitted with your application, including the police report, the letter from Defensores de la Fe, your professional resume, and letters of recommendation. I may have further questions for you later, but for now, this concludes the interview. We will notify you of our decision in writing. Do you have any questions for me?

APPLICANT: No, Officer Miller, I don't have any questions. Thank you for your time.

OFFICER: You're welcome.
