INTERVIEW BEGINS

OFFICER: Good morning, Mr. Rodriguez. My name is Officer Miller, and my badge number is AO-7769. I am an asylum officer with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. This interview is to determine whether you are eligible for asylum in the United States. You understand that you are in removal proceedings, and this interview is part of your defense against deportation. Do you understand these preliminary remarks?

APPLICANT: Yes, Officer. I understand.

OFFICER: I need to inform you that I will be recording this interview electronically. Everything you say will be under oath. Please raise your right hand and repeat after me: “I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God.”

APPLICANT: I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God.

OFFICER: Thank you. Please state your full name and date of birth for the record.

APPLICANT: My full name is Ricardo Antonio Rodriguez, and my date of birth is March 12, 1995.

OFFICER: Thank you. Let's begin. Can you please tell me about your background? Where were you born, and where did you grow up?

APPLICANT: I was born and raised in Tegucigalpa, Honduras. I lived there my whole life until I came to the United States.

OFFICER: And can you tell me about your family?

APPLICANT: Yes. I have two sisters, Maria and Sofia. Maria is older than me, and Sofia is younger. They still live in Tegucigalpa with my mother. My father passed away a few years ago from a heart attack.

OFFICER: I'm sorry to hear that. Now, let's talk about your education. I see from your application that you have a doctoral degree. Can you elaborate on your educational background?

APPLICANT: Yes, of course. I attended the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de Honduras in Tegucigalpa. I first obtained a Bachelor's degree in Hospitality Management. Then, I continued my studies and earned a Master’s degree in the same field. After working for a few years, I decided to pursue a doctorate. I completed my Ph.D. in Business Administration with a specialization in Service Innovation.

OFFICER: That's impressive. What did your doctoral research focus on?

APPLICANT: My dissertation explored the impact of technology on customer service in the hospitality industry in developing countries. I specifically looked at how mobile applications and online platforms can be used to improve customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.

OFFICER: And what kind of work have you done? You mentioned working after your Master's.

APPLICANT: Yes, after my Master's, I worked as a manager at a hotel in Tegucigalpa, Hotel Paraiso. I was responsible for overseeing the daily operations of the front desk, housekeeping, and food service departments. After I finished my Ph.D., I started working as a consultant for small businesses in the tourism sector, helping them to improve their service delivery and attract more customers. I was also teaching part-time at the university.

OFFICER: I understand. Now, let's move on to the reasons why you left Honduras. Your application indicates that you fear persecution based on your membership in a particular social group. Can you explain what that group is and why you fear persecution?

APPLICANT: Yes. My particular social group is… it’s kind of difficult to explain. It’s men… educated men, with advanced degrees, who work in the service industry, and who are seen as… well, as targets for extortion by gangs. Especially if they are perceived as successful.

OFFICER: Can you elaborate on why that specific group is targeted?

APPLICANT: The gangs, like MS-13 and Barrio 18, they see people like me as easy targets. They assume that because I have a good education and a good job, I have money. They also see us as less likely to go to the police because we don't want to risk our reputations or put our families in danger. They know we have something to lose. It’s a… a matter of perception, I think. They perceive us as weak and wealthy, even if we are not.

OFFICER: Can you describe any specific incidents that led you to fear for your safety?

APPLICANT: Yes. It started about… maybe six months before I left Honduras. I began receiving phone calls. The caller didn’t identify himself at first. He would just say things like, "We know who you are. We know where you live." Then he started demanding money. He said if I didn't pay, something bad would happen to me or my family.

OFFICER: Did he specify how much money he wanted?

APPLICANT: At first, it was a small amount, maybe 5,000 Lempiras. I paid it because I was scared. I thought it would be a one-time thing. But then the calls kept coming, and the amount kept increasing. The last time, they asked for 50,000 Lempiras.

OFFICER: Did you report these incidents to the police?

APPLICANT: No, Officer. I didn't. Everyone knows that the police in Honduras are either corrupt or they are simply outgunned by the gangs. Reporting it would have been like painting a target on my back. It would have made things even worse. My friends… some of them have gone to the police, and nothing happened. Some were even… harmed.

OFFICER: Can you provide more details about what happened to your friends?

APPLICANT: One friend, his name was Carlos. He was also a manager at a hotel. He reported the extortion to the police, and a few weeks later, he was found dead. They said it was a robbery gone wrong, but everyone knew it was the gang. Another friend, Maria, she worked as a teacher. She refused to pay, and they threatened her family. She had to move to another city, but even there, she wasn't safe. She eventually left the country.

OFFICER: You mentioned the last demand was for 50,000 Lempiras. What happened after that?

APPLICANT: I didn't have that kind of money. I told them I couldn't pay. The caller became very angry. He said, "You think you're too good for us? You think you can ignore us? We'll show you what happens when you disrespect us." A few days later, I was walking home from the university, and two men on a motorcycle pulled up beside me. One of them pointed a gun at me and said, "This is a warning. Next time, it won't be just a warning."

OFFICER: Did you recognize the men?

APPLICANT: No, Officer. They were wearing helmets. I couldn't see their faces. But I knew… I knew they were from the gang.

OFFICER: What did you do after that incident?

APPLICANT: I was terrified. I went home and told my mother and sisters everything. They were very scared, too. We decided that I had to leave the country. It was the only way to protect myself and my family.

OFFICER: Did you consider moving to another part of Honduras instead of leaving the country altogether?

APPLICANT: Yes, we did. But we didn't think it would be safe. The gangs have influence everywhere in Honduras. Even if I moved to a different city, they could still find me. And I didn't want to put my family at risk by moving them. Also, to find a job in my field… it’s very difficult.

OFFICER: Can you tell me about your journey to the United States?

APPLICANT: Yes. I sold everything I had to pay for the journey. I traveled through Guatemala and Mexico. It was very dangerous. I had to pay "coyotes" to help me cross the borders. I saw many terrible things along the way. I entered the United States near San Ysidro, California. I presented myself to immigration officials and requested asylum.

OFFICER: Do you have any documents or other evidence to support your claims?

APPLICANT: Yes, Officer. I have submitted several documents with my application. I have copies of the threatening messages I received on my phone. I also have a newspaper article about the death of my friend Carlos. And I have a letter from Maria, the teacher who had to leave the country, describing her experiences. I also included copies of my diplomas and transcripts to verify my education and professional background. I also have a police report of the incident where the men threatened me with a gun, although it doesn't mention gang involvement specifically.

OFFICER: I see. We will review those documents. What are your plans if you are granted asylum in the United States?

APPLICANT: I want to rebuild my life here. I want to use my education and experience to contribute to society. I hope to find a job in the hospitality industry, maybe as a consultant or a manager. I also would like to teach at a university if I have the opportunity. I know my English is not perfect, but I am working hard to improve it. I am also willing to learn new skills and adapt to the American culture. I just want to be safe and have a chance to live a normal life.

OFFICER: Do you have any family members in the United States?

APPLICANT: No, Officer. I don't have any family here. I came here alone. But I hope that one day, if I am granted asylum, I can bring my mother and sisters here so they can be safe, too.

OFFICER: Are they currently in danger?

APPLICANT: I believe they are. Even though I am not there anymore, the gangs know who they are. They know where they live. I worry about them every day. I send them money when I can, but it's not enough to protect them.

OFFICER: Have you contacted them since arriving in the US?

APPLICANT: Yes, when it is safe to do so. I mostly use WhatsApp, but I am always worried about the gangs monitoring their phones. I tell them to be careful.

OFFICER: Officer Rodriguez, I want to explore something further. You mentioned you were teaching part-time at the university. Did you ever consider seeking help or protection from the university administration or security?

APPLICANT: I did consider it, but I decided against it. The university administration is aware of the gang problem in Tegucigalpa, but they are limited in what they can do. They have some security on campus, but it's not enough to protect against determined criminals. Also, I feared that involving the university would only draw more attention to me and my family. The gangs often target institutions that try to resist them.

OFFICER: You mentioned that you sold everything you had to pay for the journey to the US. Can you provide more details about what you sold and how much money you received?

APPLICANT: Yes, of course. I sold my car, which was a used Toyota Corolla. I got about 4,000 US dollars for it. I also sold some of my furniture and electronics, like my television and my computer. I got maybe another 1,000 dollars for those items. My mother and sisters also contributed some of their savings, but it was not much. The total amount I had was around 6,000 dollars, which was barely enough to pay the "coyotes" and cover the expenses of the journey.

OFFICER: One last question. Why do you believe the gang targeted you specifically, as opposed to other professionals in Tegucigalpa? Was there something that made you stand out?

APPLICANT: I think… I think it was because I was starting to become known in the community. My consulting business was doing well. I was getting referrals from other businesses. And I had published a few articles in local newspapers about my research. I think the gangs saw me as someone who was successful and who had the potential to make even more money. Also, I think they saw me as someone who was not connected to any powerful people or who had any protection. I was just an ordinary person trying to make a living.

OFFICER: Thank you, Mr. Rodriguez. I have no further questions for you at this time. Do you have anything else you would like to add?

APPLICANT: No, Officer. I think I have said everything. I just want to thank you for listening to my story. I hope that you will believe me and grant me asylum so I can start a new life here in the United States.

OFFICER: Thank you for your cooperation. This interview is now concluded. We will notify you of our decision in writing.
