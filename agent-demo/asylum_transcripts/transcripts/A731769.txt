INTERVIEW BEGINS

OFFICER: Good morning, Ms. Elena Rodriguez. My name is Officer Miller, and I am an asylum officer with USCIS. Thank you for coming in today. As you know, you are in removal proceedings, and you are applying for asylum as a defense against being deported back to Honduras. Do you understand?

APPLICANT: Yes, Officer Miller, I understand. Thank you for seeing me.

OFFICER: I need to inform you of the process. This interview is under oath, meaning you must tell the truth. Everything you say will be recorded and used to determine whether you qualify for asylum. You have the right to legal representation, but I understand you are representing yourself today. Is that correct?

APPLICANT: Yes, that is correct. I could not afford a lawyer.

OFFICER: Okay. Before we begin, please raise your right hand and repeat after me: "I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God."

APPLICANT: I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God.

OFFICER: Thank you. Please be seated. I have reviewed the information you submitted with your I-589 application, but I need to ask you questions to get a more detailed understanding of your situation. Let's start with your background. Can you please state your full name and date of birth for the record?

APPLICANT: My full name is Elena Maria Rodriguez. My date of birth is July 12, 2000.

OFFICER: And you are a citizen of Honduras?

APPLICANT: Yes, I am.

OFFICER: Can you tell me about your life in Honduras? Where did you grow up, and what was your family like?

APPLICANT: I grew up in Tegucigalpa. I lived with my mother and my younger brother, Miguel. My father passed away when I was very young. My mother worked very hard to provide for us, mostly cleaning houses. It was difficult, but we were a close family.

OFFICER: You indicated in your application that you have a Bachelor's degree. Can you tell me more about your education? What did you study, and where did you attend university?

APPLICANT: Yes, I earned a Bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering from the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de Honduras. It was a four-year program. I graduated in 2022.

OFFICER: That's impressive. Civil Engineering. What made you choose that field?

APPLICANT: I always enjoyed math and science, and I wanted to do something practical that could help my community. Honduras needs better infrastructure, and I wanted to be part of building it.

OFFICER: And what did you do after you graduated?

APPLICANT: I worked for a small construction company, "Construcciones Unidas." I started as a junior engineer, assisting with project planning and site management. I was very excited to finally be working in my field.

OFFICER: Your application states that you are seeking asylum based on your fear of persecution due to your sexual orientation. Can you tell me when you first realized you were a lesbian?

APPLICANT: I think I always knew, deep down. But I didn't really acknowledge it, not even to myself, until I was around 18 or 19. I started having feelings for other women, and I couldn’t deny it anymore.

OFFICER: Was it difficult to come to terms with your sexual orientation in Honduras?

APPLICANT: Extremely. Honduras is a very conservative country. The church has a lot of influence, and there is a lot of stigma and discrimination against LGBTQ+ people. It's not accepted.

OFFICER: Did you tell your family?

APPLICANT: No. I was too afraid. I knew my mother would be heartbroken. She is very religious. I didn’t want to disappoint her. I only told a few close friends.

OFFICER: Can you describe the specific incidents that led you to fear for your safety and ultimately leave Honduras?

APPLICANT: It started with whispers and stares. People at work, especially some of the older men, would make comments. Crude jokes. Then it escalated.

OFFICER: Can you give me a specific example?

APPLICANT: Yes. In June of 2022, I was working on a construction site in the outskirts of Tegucigalpa. A group of workers started calling me names – "marimacha," "tortillera." They would leer at me and make sexually suggestive comments. One day, two of them cornered me near the supply shed. They pushed me against the wall and started making threats. They said I was disgusting and that I shouldn't be allowed to work with "decent men." They said I needed to be taught a lesson.

OFFICER: Did they physically harm you?

APPLICANT: Yes. One of them grabbed my arm very hard, and the other one tried to kiss me. I fought them off and ran away. I was terrified.

OFFICER: Did you report this incident to your supervisor or to the police?

APPLICANT: I reported it to my supervisor, but he just shrugged it off. He said I was being too sensitive and that I should just ignore them. He said, “These things happen.” I didn’t report it to the police because I didn’t trust them. The police in Honduras are often corrupt and don't take LGBTQ+ issues seriously. In fact, sometimes they are the ones perpetrating the violence.

OFFICER: Did things get worse after that incident?

APPLICANT: Yes. After that, the harassment became more frequent and more aggressive. They would leave threatening notes on my desk. One time, they vandalized my car, spray-painting homophobic slurs on it.

OFFICER: Do you have any evidence of these incidents, such as photos of the vandalism or copies of the threatening notes?

APPLICANT: I have photos of the vandalism on my phone. I submitted them with my application. I don't have the notes anymore. I burned them because I was scared.

OFFICER: I see. You also mentioned an incident involving a group of men outside a nightclub. Can you describe that?

APPLICANT: Yes. In October of 2022, I went to a nightclub with some friends. It was a gay-friendly club, one of the few in Tegucigalpa. As we were leaving, a group of men started yelling insults at us. They followed us down the street, throwing rocks and bottles. One of the rocks hit me in the head. I fell to the ground, and they started kicking me.

OFFICER: Were you seriously injured?

APPLICANT: I had a concussion and some bruises. My friends managed to pull me away and get me to safety.

OFFICER: Did you report this incident to the police?

APPLICANT: No. My friends told me not to. They said it would be pointless and that the police might even make things worse. They said the police often target LGBTQ+ people.

OFFICER: Did you consider relocating to a different part of Honduras to escape the harassment?

APPLICANT: I did. I thought about moving to San Pedro Sula, which is a larger city, but I heard that the situation there is even worse for LGBTQ+ people. There are gangs that specifically target gay and lesbian people. I also considered moving to a smaller town, but I was afraid that I would be even more visible and vulnerable there. Plus, it would be hard to find work. My degree wouldn't be as useful in a rural area.

OFFICER: Why couldn't you seek protection from the Honduran authorities?

APPLICANT: As I mentioned, the police are often corrupt and discriminatory. They are not there to protect LGBTQ+ people. They are often part of the problem. And even if they wanted to help, they are often powerless to stop the violence. The gangs and the other criminal groups are too powerful. The government is weak and unable to protect its citizens, especially vulnerable groups like us.

OFFICER: What was the final incident that made you decide to leave Honduras?

APPLICANT: In December of 2022, I was walking home from work when I was attacked again. Two men grabbed me and dragged me into an alley. They beat me and robbed me. They told me that I was a disgrace to Honduras and that I should leave the country. They said if they saw me again, they would kill me.

OFFICER: Did you recognize these men?

APPLICANT: No, I didn’t. But I believe they were the same men who had been harassing me at work. I was terrified. I knew I had to leave Honduras to survive.

OFFICER: And when did you leave Honduras?

APPLICANT: I left on January 10, 2023.

OFFICER: Can you describe your journey to the United States?

APPLICANT: I took a bus to Guatemala, then to Mexico. I traveled with a group of other migrants. It was a very dangerous journey. We had to cross borders illegally, and we were constantly worried about being robbed or attacked. I finally crossed the border into the United States near Tijuana. I presented myself to immigration officials and asked for asylum.

OFFICER: You mentioned you had prior legal status in Honduras. Could you elaborate on that? Were you ever accused or convicted of any crimes?

APPLICANT: Yes, I had a driver's license and a national identity card. I was never accused or convicted of any crimes. I always tried to stay out of trouble.

OFFICER: Do you have any family members in the United States?

APPLICANT: No, I don't. I am completely alone here.

OFFICER: If you are granted asylum, what are your plans for the future?

APPLICANT: I want to rebuild my life. I want to find a job as a civil engineer. I want to use my skills to contribute to this country. I want to live in a place where I can be safe and accepted for who I am. I want to finally be free. I want to learn more English, and I hope to eventually get my Master's degree here.

OFFICER: Do you have any concerns for family members who remain in Honduras?

APPLICANT: Yes, I am very worried about my mother and my brother, Miguel. I haven't told them why I left. I just told them I needed to find work. I am afraid that if they find out I am seeking asylum because I am a lesbian, they will be targeted. My mother is elderly, and Miguel is not very strong. I worry about their safety every day.

OFFICER: Have you submitted any country conditions reports or other documents to support your claim?

APPLICANT: Yes, I submitted several reports from organizations like Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International that document the discrimination and violence against LGBTQ+ people in Honduras. I also submitted a letter from a friend in Honduras who is involved in LGBTQ+ activism.

OFFICER: Okay. Ms. Rodriguez, I have a few more questions about your education. You mentioned graduating from Universidad Nacional Autónoma de Honduras. Can you provide any documentation to verify your degree?

APPLICANT: Yes, I have a copy of my diploma and my transcript. I submitted them with my application. I also have the original documents here with me.

OFFICER: I appreciate that. And regarding your work experience, can you describe a specific project you worked on at Construcciones Unidas?

APPLICANT: Certainly. One project I was heavily involved in was the design and construction of a new water treatment facility for a small community outside of Tegucigalpa. I assisted the senior engineers with the structural calculations, the site layout, and the materials procurement. It was a challenging project, but it was also very rewarding to see the positive impact it had on the community.

OFFICER: That's good to hear. It sounds like you have valuable skills. Do you believe your engineering background would be beneficial to you in the United States?

APPLICANT: Absolutely. I am confident that I can find work in my field here. I am willing to start at an entry-level position and work my way up. I am eager to learn new technologies and contribute to the American economy.

OFFICER: One final question. You entered the United States without proper documentation. Can you explain why you didn't seek legal avenues to enter the country?

APPLICANT: I know entering without documentation was not the ideal way, but I was desperate. I feared for my life, and I believed that I would not be able to obtain a visa or other legal permission to enter the United States quickly enough. I felt that I had no other choice. I understand that this may be viewed negatively, but I hope you can understand my situation.

OFFICER: Thank you, Ms. Rodriguez. I have no further questions for you at this time. Do you have anything else you would like to add?

APPLICANT: Yes, Officer. I just want to say that I am telling the truth. I am not trying to take advantage of the system. I am genuinely afraid to return to Honduras. I just want a chance to live a safe and peaceful life. I am willing to work hard and contribute to this country. Please, I beg you, grant me asylum.

OFFICER: Thank you, Ms. Rodriguez. This interview is now concluded. We will notify you of our decision in writing. You can expect to receive a notice in the mail. Do you understand?

APPLICANT: Yes, I understand. Thank you very much, Officer Miller.
