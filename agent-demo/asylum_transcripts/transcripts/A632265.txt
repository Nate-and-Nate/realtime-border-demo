INTERVIEW BEGINS

OFFICER: Good morning. My name is Officer Miller, and I am an Asylum Officer with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. This interview is to determine whether you are eligible for asylum in the United States. I need to inform you that you have been placed under oath, and that anything you say during this interview may be used in deciding your case. Do you understand?

OFFICER: Please raise your right hand. Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

APPLICANT: My name is Jean-Pierre Dubois.

OFFICER: And what is your date of birth?

APPLICANT: January 15, 1981.

OFFICER: And your place of birth?

APPLICANT: Port-au-Prince, Haiti.

OFFICER: Mr. Dubois, you are currently in removal proceedings, and you are seeking asylum as a defense against deportation. Is that correct?

APPLICANT: Yes, that is correct.

OFFICER: Your application states that you fear persecution in Haiti based on your race. Is this also correct?

APPLICANT: Yes, because I am… I am Black, and… things are very bad for Black people there.

OFFICER: Okay. Before we get into the specifics of your claims, I want to get a better understanding of your background. Can you tell me about your education?

APPLICANT: I… I didn’t go to school much. I had to work to help my family.

OFFICER: What is the highest level of education you completed?

APPLICANT: I… maybe a little bit of primary school. Not even finished.

OFFICER: Okay. Your application states that you have a professional background in business and finance. Can you elaborate on that?

APPLICANT: Yes, I… I work with money. I… I help people with their money.

OFFICER: Can you describe your specific job duties and responsibilities?

APPLICANT: I… I would, you know, help them keep track of their money. I would advise them on what to buy, what to sell. Small business, you know.

OFFICER: What was the name of the company or business you worked for?

APPLICANT: It was… my own business. I worked for myself.

OFFICER: Can you provide any documentation to support your claim of owning and operating a business, such as tax records, business licenses, or bank statements?

APPLICANT: No, I… I don't have those things. Everything was… you know, cash. It was all… under the table.

OFFICER: How long did you operate this business?

APPLICANT: For… maybe five years. Before I left.

OFFICER: Okay. Now, let’s talk about why you left Haiti. Can you describe the specific incidents of persecution you experienced or witnessed that led you to fear returning?

APPLICANT: It’s… it’s hard to explain. The… the gangs, they are everywhere. They target Black people. They rob us, they beat us. They… they do worse things.

OFFICER: Can you give me specific examples of incidents that happened to you personally? Dates, locations, and details of what occurred?

APPLICANT: Okay. One time… maybe in… 2021, I think. I was walking home from… from helping a client. It was in… near my house, in La Saline. A group of men stopped me. They… they said I was… they used bad words. They said I was a Black dog. They… they took my money. They hit me.

OFFICER: How many men were involved?

APPLICANT: Maybe… four or five.

OFFICER: Did you report this incident to the police?

APPLICANT: No. The police… they don’t help. Sometimes, they are even involved.

OFFICER: Okay. Can you describe any other specific incidents that you experienced?

APPLICANT: Yes. Another time… maybe six months later… I was… I was trying to buy food at the market. A man… he pushed me. He said… “Get out of the way, Black man. This is not for you.” He… he took my food.

OFFICER: Did you know this man?

APPLICANT: No, I didn’t know him. He was just… he was a gang member, I think. They… they control everything.

OFFICER: You said these gangs target Black people. Can you explain why you believe they do so? What is the motivation behind this persecution?

APPLICANT: Because… because they hate us. They think we are… less than them. They think we are… in the way. They want to control everything, and they see us as a threat.

OFFICER: Your application mentions that you identify as non-binary. Did your gender identity play a role in the persecution you experienced in Haiti?

APPLICANT: No… not really. It was more about… the color of my skin.

OFFICER: Did you ever try to relocate to a different part of Haiti to avoid these problems?

APPLICANT: Yes, I… I tried to go to my cousin’s house in Jacmel. But… it wasn’t safe there either. The gangs are everywhere.

OFFICER: How long did you stay in Jacmel?

APPLICANT: Maybe… two weeks.

OFFICER: And why did you leave after only two weeks?

APPLICANT: Because… I heard that the gangs were coming there too. My cousin told me I should leave. He was afraid for his family.

OFFICER: Did you seek protection from the Haitian authorities at any point?

APPLICANT: No. Like I said, the police… they don’t help. They are corrupt.

OFFICER: Can you elaborate on why you believe the police would not help you?

APPLICANT: Because… they are paid off by the gangs. They are afraid of them.

OFFICER: What evidence do you have to support your claim that the police are paid off by the gangs?

APPLICANT: Everyone knows this! It’s… it’s common knowledge. But… I don’t have proof, like a paper. It's just… what everyone says.

OFFICER: Mr. Dubois, you mentioned being robbed and assaulted. Did you sustain any injuries as a result of these incidents?

APPLICANT: Yes… I had bruises. One time, my head was bleeding.

OFFICER: Did you seek medical attention for these injuries?

APPLICANT: No. I couldn’t afford it. And… I was afraid to go to the hospital. I didn’t want to attract attention.

OFFICER: You stated you don’t have any documentation to support your business. Do you have any other evidence to support your claims of persecution, such as photos, medical records, or witness statements?

APPLICANT: No… I left everything behind. I had to leave quickly.

OFFICER: Your application states that you do not have any dependent family members. Is that correct?

APPLICANT: Yes, that is correct.

OFFICER: Do you have any family members still in Haiti?

APPLICANT: Yes, I have… a sister and some cousins.

OFFICER: Are they also experiencing persecution because of their race?

APPLICANT: Yes… they are. But… they are used to it. They don’t want to leave.

OFFICER: Why can't you return to Haiti?

APPLICANT: Because… I am afraid they will kill me. The gangs… they will find me. I am a Black person, and… I am a target.

OFFICER: Can you describe your journey to the United States?

APPLICANT: I… I took a bus to the Dominican Republic. Then… I flew to Mexico. Then… I crossed the border.

OFFICER: When did you cross the border?

APPLICANT: In… March of this year.

OFFICER: Where did you cross the border?

APPLICANT: In… near Tijuana.

OFFICER: How long were you in Mexico?

APPLICANT: Maybe… one week.

OFFICER: Did you have any problems while you were in Mexico?

APPLICANT: Yes… the police… they stopped me. They asked for money. I had to give them everything I had.

OFFICER: What are your plans if you are granted asylum in the United States?

APPLICANT: I want to… to work. To start a new life.

OFFICER: You mentioned having a background in business and finance. How do you plan to utilize those skills in the United States, given your lack of formal education and documentation?

APPLICANT: I… I can learn. I am a hard worker. I can… I can do anything. Maybe… I can help people with their taxes. Or… something like that.

OFFICER: Mr. Dubois, I'm going to ask you some questions to clarify a few points. You stated that you operated your own business in Haiti for approximately five years. Given that you have no formal education, how did you acquire the skills necessary to manage finances and advise clients on business matters?

APPLICANT: I… I learned from experience. I watched other people. I… I am good with numbers.

OFFICER: You also mentioned that all your transactions were conducted in cash and "under the table." This suggests that your business practices may not have been entirely legal. Can you explain why you chose to operate in this manner?

APPLICANT: It was… it was the only way to survive. Everyone does it that way in Haiti. The government… they take too much.

OFFICER: You stated that you fear persecution based on your race. However, you also mentioned that your gender identity did not play a significant role in the incidents you experienced. Can you explain why you emphasized race as the primary basis for your asylum claim?

APPLICANT: Because… that is the main reason. The gangs… they don’t care about my gender. They just see a Black person.

OFFICER: Mr. Dubois, I've noticed some inconsistencies in your testimony regarding your education and professional experience. Your application states a background in business and finance, yet you've indicated limited formal education. Can you reconcile these discrepancies?

APPLICANT: I… I might have… I tried to make myself sound better. I… I was afraid you wouldn’t believe me if I told the truth.

OFFICER: Thank you for your honesty. I have no further questions for you at this time. Do you have anything else you would like to add?

APPLICANT: No… I just… I hope you will believe me. I am afraid to go back.

OFFICER: Thank you for your time, Mr. Dubois. I will now review your application and the testimony you have provided today. You will receive a written decision in the mail.
