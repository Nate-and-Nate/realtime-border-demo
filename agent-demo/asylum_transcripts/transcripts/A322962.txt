INTERVIEW BEGINS

OFFICER: Good morning, Mr. Rodriguez. My name is Officer Miller, and this is Officer Davies. We are asylum officers with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Today, we will be conducting an interview regarding your application for asylum. Please note that this interview is being recorded. I will now administer the oath. Please raise your right hand and repeat after me: “Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?”

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes, I swear.

OFFICER: Thank you. And for the record, could the interpreter please state their name and interpreter number?

INTERPRETER: My name is Maria Sanchez, interpreter number 12345.

OFFICER: Thank you, Ms. Sanchez. Also present is Mr. Rodriguez's legal representative, is that correct?

LEGAL REPRESENTATIVE: Yes, Officer. My name is Sarah Chen, and I am an attorney representing Mr. Rodriguez.

OFFICER: Thank you, Ms. Chen. Mr. Rodriguez, I understand you have applied for asylum in the United States. Before we begin, do you understand the purpose of this interview?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes. I understand.

OFFICER: Very well. Let’s start with some background information. Can you please state your full name and date of birth for the record?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) My full name is Ricardo Ernesto Rodriguez. My date of birth is July 12, 1977.

OFFICER: And where were you born?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I was born in San Salvador, El Salvador.

OFFICER: Mr. Rodriguez, can you tell me about your educational background?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I completed secondary school, up to what you call high school here, at the Instituto Nacional de San Salvador. I also took some legal courses, not a full university degree, but courses focused on law.

OFFICER: Could you please elaborate on these legal courses? What specifically did they cover, and for how long did you study?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) They were offered by a private institute, a… a *centro de estudios legales*. I attended for about two years, learning about Salvadoran law, mostly related to property rights and civil disputes. It gave me a good foundation.

OFFICER: And what did you do professionally in El Salvador?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I worked as a *paralegal* for a small law firm in San Salvador. I helped with research, drafting documents, and… and assisting lawyers with their cases.

OFFICER: What kind of cases did the law firm handle?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Mostly civil cases – property disputes, family law, and some criminal defense.

OFFICER: Now, Mr. Rodriguez, can you tell us why you left El Salvador and are seeking asylum in the United States?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I left because… because I was being threatened and persecuted because of my race. Because I am *blanco*, white, and people… gangs, and others… they target us. They think we have money, or connections.

OFFICER: Can you describe specific incidents that led you to fear for your safety?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes. It started about three years ago. I live in a neighborhood that is becoming more… more dangerous. The *pandillas*, the gangs, are gaining control. At first, it was just… warnings. They would stare at me, follow me. Then, one night, about two years ago, I was walking home from work…

OFFICER: Can you give me the specific date or approximate date of this incident?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) It was… around April 15, 2021. I remember because it was close to my mother’s birthday. It was late, about 9 pm. Two men approached me. They were young, maybe 18 or 19. They said… they said, "Hey, *chele*, what do you have for us?" *Chele* is a derogatory term for white people.

OFFICER: And what happened next?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) They demanded my wallet and my phone. I gave them what I had. But they weren’t satisfied. They said I was hiding more. They pushed me against a wall and started to search me. One of them pulled out a knife.

OFFICER: Did they injure you?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes. He cut my arm. Not deep, but it bled. They took my watch and ran away.

OFFICER: Did you report this incident to the police?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) (Hesitates) No.

OFFICER: Why not?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Because… because the police are corrupt. They are often in league with the gangs. Reporting it would have made things worse. The gangs would have known I went to the police, and they would have retaliated.

OFFICER: Can you describe any other incidents?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes. About six months later, in October 2021, I received a threatening note at my apartment. It was slipped under the door. It said, "We know where you live, *chele*. Pay up, or you will regret it."

OFFICER: Do you have that note?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) No, I… I destroyed it. I was scared.

OFFICER: Did you recognize the handwriting?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) No. It was… it was just scribbled.

OFFICER: Did you pay them?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) No. I didn’t have the money they wanted. I started to live in fear. I changed my routine. I avoided walking alone at night.

OFFICER: Did you consider moving to a different part of El Salvador?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes, I did. But… but the gangs are everywhere. They are in control of many neighborhoods. Even if I moved, I would still be a target. And my family… my wife and children… they would be at risk too.

OFFICER: What makes you believe your wife and children would be at risk?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Because they are my family! If they target me because of my race, they will target my family too. They know who my family are and where they live.

OFFICER: Have they been directly threatened or harmed?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Not… not directly, but the threat is always there. The fear is constant. My wife is constantly worried. My children are afraid to go outside.

OFFICER: Have you sought protection from the Salvadoran authorities in any other way besides reporting the robbery?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) No. I did not see any other avenue. The police are not to be trusted.

OFFICER: Why do you believe you cannot return to El Salvador?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) (Voice trembling) Because I am afraid they will kill me. Or my family. The gangs are too powerful. The government cannot protect us. There is no safe place for us in El Salvador.

OFFICER: You mentioned you have family ties to citizens here in the United States. Could you elaborate on that?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes. My sister, Maria, is a U.S. citizen. She has lived here for over twenty years. She sponsored me for a tourist visa.

OFFICER: And your sister is aware of your asylum application?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes, she is. She is very supportive.

OFFICER: Mr. Rodriguez, can you describe your journey to the United States?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I flew from San Salvador to… to Mexico City. Then, I took a bus to Tijuana. From there, I crossed the border into the United States. I presented myself to immigration officials and requested asylum.

OFFICER: When did you enter the United States?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) (Consults document) January 10, 2023.

OFFICER: Do you have any supporting evidence to corroborate your claims of persecution?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I have submitted a police report regarding the robbery, although it doesn’t mention the racial motivation. I also have a letter from my sister, Maria, attesting to my fear of returning to El Salvador. And a country conditions report about gang violence in El Salvador.

OFFICER: (Officer Davies speaks) Ms. Chen, do you have anything to add at this time?

LEGAL REPRESENTATIVE: Yes, Officer. We would like to submit additional evidence, including news articles detailing the targeting of white Salvadorans by gangs and expert testimony on the Salvadoran government’s inability to protect its citizens from gang violence. We believe this evidence will further support Mr. Rodriguez’s claim for asylum. We also want to emphasize the specific vulnerability Mr. Rodriguez faces due to his perceived socioeconomic status stemming from his race.

OFFICER: Thank you, Ms. Chen. We will review any additional documentation you submit. Mr. Rodriguez, what are your plans if you are granted asylum in the United States?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I want to work, to provide for my family. I want to use my legal skills to help others. I am willing to do whatever it takes to build a new life here. Perhaps I can work as a legal assistant again, or find some other way to use my knowledge. I am also eager to improve my English.

OFFICER: Regarding your English, what steps are you taking to learn the language?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I am taking English classes online. It is difficult, but I am trying my best. I know it is important for my future here.

OFFICER: One last question, Mr. Rodriguez. You mentioned that the police report you submitted doesn’t mention that the robbery was racially motivated. Why is that?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Because I was afraid to tell them. I didn’t trust them. I thought they would dismiss it, or even make things worse. In El Salvador, it is difficult to speak out against these things.

OFFICER: Thank you, Mr. Rodriguez. Do you have anything else you would like to add before we conclude this interview?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I just want to say that I am truly afraid to return to El Salvador. I am asking for your help to protect me and my family.

LEGAL REPRESENTATIVE: Officer, if I may, I would like to reiterate that Mr. Rodriguez's fears are well-founded given the documented history of violence against white individuals in El Salvador, coupled with the government's inability to provide adequate protection. His testimony, taken in conjunction with the supporting documentation, clearly establishes his eligibility for asylum.

OFFICER: Thank you, Ms. Chen. Mr. Rodriguez, this concludes our interview. We will notify you of our decision in writing.

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Thank you very much.
