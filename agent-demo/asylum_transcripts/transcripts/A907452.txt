INTERVIEW BEGINS

OFFICER: Good morning, Ms. Rodriguez. My name is Officer Miller, and I am an Asylum Officer with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. This is an interview to determine if you are eligible for asylum in the United States. With me today is your attorney, Ms. Jenkins.

ATTORNEY: Good morning, Officer.

OFFICER: Ms. Rodriguez, I need to inform you that you will be placed under oath, and you must answer all of my questions truthfully. Do you understand?

APPLICANT: Yes, I understand.

OFFICER: Please raise your right hand. Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

APPLICANT: I do.

OFFICER: Thank you. Please be seated. Ms. Rodriguez, could you please state your full name and date of birth for the record?

APPLICANT: My name is Maria Elena Rodriguez. My birthday is July 12, 1963.

OFFICER: Thank you. Ms. Rodriguez, you are seeking asylum in the United States based on a fear of persecution in Venezuela due to your political opinion. Is that correct?

APPLICANT: Yes, that is correct.

OFFICER: Let's start with your background. Where in Venezuela were you born and where did you live most of your life?

APPLICANT: I was born in Caracas, and I lived there all my life. In a small apartment in the center.

OFFICER: And what is the highest level of education you completed?

APPLICANT: I… I didn’t go to school, not really. I learned to read a little from my mother, but that's it.

OFFICER: So you have no formal education?

APPLICANT: No, no formal schooling.

OFFICER: What about your work history? What kind of work have you done in Venezuela?

APPLICANT: I… I have done odd jobs, you know? Cleaning houses, sometimes helping at the market selling vegetables. Nothing steady.

OFFICER: You stated in your application that you were unemployed. Is that correct?

APPLICANT: Yes, most of the time. It's hard to find work, especially now.

OFFICER: Ms. Rodriguez, can you describe your political opinions that led to your fear of persecution?

APPLICANT: I… I don’t like Maduro. He is ruining the country. Everything is getting worse. There's no food, no medicine, nothing works.

OFFICER: Can you be more specific about how you expressed these opinions? Did you participate in any protests, political organizations, or openly criticize the government?

APPLICANT: Well, I talked to my neighbors, my friends. Everyone feels the same. I went to one protest, maybe two, a long time ago. But I didn’t do anything special.

OFFICER: When were these protests? Can you describe them?

APPLICANT: Oh, it was… I think in 2017, maybe 2018. There were many people marching, shouting slogans against Maduro. I was just there, with the crowd.

OFFICER: You stated you attended two protests. Can you describe the second protest you attended?

APPLICANT: (Hesitates) The second… I don’t remember exactly. It was similar. Just people complaining about the situation. I don’t recall the exact date. It was around the same time, I think.

OFFICER: Ms. Rodriguez, your application mentions an incident where you were threatened because of your political views. Can you describe that incident in detail?

APPLICANT: Yes. It happened about a year before I left. Some men… I think they were from the colectivos, you know, the government supporters. They came to my building. They were shouting, looking for people who were against Maduro. They knocked on my door.

OFFICER: What happened when they knocked on your door?

APPLICANT: I didn't open it. I was too scared. They were shouting things like, “We know who you are! We are watching you!” They were banging on the door for a long time.

OFFICER: Did they identify themselves as colectivos? Did you see any weapons?

APPLICANT: I… I didn’t see them clearly, but I heard them talking. They were saying things that only the colectivos would say. I didn't open the door, so I didn’t see any weapons, but I was terrified.

OFFICER: Did you report this incident to the police?

APPLICANT: No. What's the point? The police are with them. They wouldn’t do anything to help me.

OFFICER: After this incident, did you experience any other threats or harassment?

APPLICANT: Not directly, but I was always afraid. I saw them in the neighborhood sometimes. I felt like they were watching me.

OFFICER: Did you ever consider moving to another part of Caracas or another city in Venezuela to avoid these problems?

APPLICANT: No. I don’t have any family anywhere else. I don’t have any money to move.

OFFICER: Ms. Rodriguez, in your application, you mentioned that you couldn't return to Venezuela because you feared for your life. Can you elaborate on why you believe your life is in danger?

APPLICANT: Because of what happened. The colectivos, the threats… They know I don’t support the government. If I go back, they will find me. They will do something to me.

OFFICER: What specific actions do you believe they will take against you?

APPLICANT: (Long pause) I… I don’t know exactly. But they are violent. They hurt people. They disappear people. I am afraid they will hurt me, or worse.

OFFICER: Do you have any evidence to support your claim that these colectivos are specifically targeting you? For instance, did they ever mention your name directly, or leave any written threats?

APPLICANT: No, not exactly. But I know they were talking about me. I could feel it.

OFFICER: You stated you went to one or two protests in 2017 or 2018. Can you explain why you waited so long to leave Venezuela, especially given the threats you described?

APPLICANT: It’s… it’s complicated. I didn’t have the money. I was hoping things would get better. But they didn’t. They got worse. Eventually, a friend helped me get a loan to come here.

OFFICER: Ms. Rodriguez, can you provide the name and contact information of this friend who assisted you?

APPLICANT: (Hesitates) I… I don’t want to get her in trouble. She could get into trouble with the government if I mention her name.

OFFICER: I understand your concern, but providing this information would help us verify your claim.

ATTORNEY: Officer, my client is understandably afraid to provide information that could endanger her friend. We believe her testimony is sufficient.

OFFICER: I understand, Ms. Jenkins. Ms. Rodriguez, what documents do you have to support your asylum claim?

APPLICANT: I have… I have some pictures of the protests. And I have a letter from my neighbor, saying that the colectivos came to my building.

OFFICER: Let me review those. (Officer examines the documents). These appear to be general photos of protests and a letter from a neighbor, but the letter is not notarized and lacks specific details.

OFFICER: Ms. Rodriguez, you mentioned you are 60 years old and have limited work experience. What are your plans if you are granted asylum in the United States? How do you plan to support yourself?

APPLICANT: I… I don’t know exactly. I hope to find some work. Maybe cleaning houses again. Or maybe I can learn something new. I am willing to work hard.

OFFICER: Ms. Rodriguez, how did you travel to the United States, and when did you arrive?

APPLICANT: I flew from Caracas to Mexico City. Then I crossed the border into the United States. I arrived about six months ago.

OFFICER: Did you have a visa to enter Mexico?

APPLICANT: Yes, I got a tourist visa.

OFFICER: And how did you cross the border into the United States?

APPLICANT: (Hesitates) I… I paid someone to help me.

OFFICER: Can you provide details about this person and the process of crossing the border?

APPLICANT: I don’t know his name. He just helped me cross. It was… difficult.

OFFICER: Ms. Rodriguez, are any members of your family still in Venezuela?

APPLICANT: No. I am alone.

OFFICER: So you have no close relatives remaining in Venezuela?

APPLICANT: No.

OFFICER: Ms. Rodriguez, in your application, you indicated you had a sister who lived in Valencia. Is that information incorrect?

APPLICANT: (Visibly flustered) Oh. Yes, I… I forgot. She is there. But we don’t talk. We haven't talked in years.

OFFICER: Why don’t you talk?

APPLICANT: We had a… a disagreement. A long time ago.

OFFICER: Is she aware of your political views?

APPLICANT: I… I don’t know.

OFFICER: Ms. Rodriguez, have you ever been arrested or convicted of any crime, either in Venezuela or in the United States?

APPLICANT: No, never.

OFFICER: Ms. Rodriguez, do you have anything else you would like to add at this time?

APPLICANT: No, I think I have told you everything.

OFFICER: Ms. Jenkins, do you have any questions for your client?

ATTORNEY: No, Officer, not at this time.

OFFICER: Okay, Ms. Rodriguez, this concludes our interview. We will review your application and the information you have provided, and you will receive a decision in the mail. Thank you for your time.

APPLICANT: Thank you.

ATTORNEY: Thank you, Officer.
