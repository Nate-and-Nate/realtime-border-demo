OFFICER: Did you have any formal training in electronics, beyond learning from your father?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) No formal training, no. Just what I learned from my papa. But I am… good at it.

OFFICER: I understand. Now, Ms. Rodriguez, why did you leave Nicaragua?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter, voice trembling) Because… because I am afraid. Because I am… I am persecuted.

OFFICER: Can you explain what you mean by "persecuted"?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Because I am… different. Because I am non-binary. Because I don't fit in the boxes. The government… the police… they don't like people like me.

OFFICER: Can you give me specific examples of how you were persecuted?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) It started… a few years ago. Maybe… 2018. After the protests. The police… they started to harass people. Anyone who looked… different. I was walking home one night, and they stopped me. They asked me… insulting questions. About my clothes, about my hair. They called me names… derogatory names. They pushed me.

OFFICER: Do you remember the specific location of this incident?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes. It was near the central market in Managua. On Avenida Bolivar.

OFFICER: Did you report this to the police?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) No! Never! To report to the police who harass me? They would not help. They are the problem.

OFFICER: I understand. Can you tell me about other incidents?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) It got worse. After that… they started following me. When I walked to the market, to buy food. When I visited my sister. They would stare. They would whisper. One time… they stopped me again. They searched me. They took my money. They said… "This is what happens to people like you."

OFFICER: Do you remember when this second incident occurred?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Maybe… six months after the first time. Early 2019.

OFFICER: Did you ever try to move to another part of Nicaragua to avoid this harassment?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I thought about it. But… where could I go? The government is everywhere. The police are everywhere. And also… my family is in Managua. My sister… she needs me.

OFFICER: What is your sister's name?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Her name is Isabella Rodriguez.

OFFICER: Is she also non-binary?

OFFICER: Are your cousins also in Nicaragua?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes, they are.

OFFICER: Are they aware of your gender identity?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes. Some are supportive, others… less so. But they know.

OFFICER: You mentioned the police took your money. Did they ever physically harm you beyond pushing you?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter, hesitating) Yes… once. It was in 2021. I was walking home from my sister's house. It was late. Two men… I think they were police, but they were not in uniform… they grabbed me. They dragged me into an alley. They beat me. They left me there.

OFFICER: Did you seek medical attention after this incident?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) No. I was too afraid. I went to my sister. She helped me.

OFFICER: Does your sister have any documentation of this event, perhaps photos of your injuries?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Maybe. I can ask her. I didn't think to take pictures then. I was just… scared.

OFFICER: I understand. Now, Ms. Rodriguez, why do you believe you cannot return to Nicaragua?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Because… they will kill me. They hate people like me. The government… they encourage this hatred. If I go back… I will be arrested, I will be beaten, I will be… I will be killed.

OFFICER: Do you have any documents or evidence to support your claim that you are persecuted in Nicaragua because of your gender identity?

They see us as… as a threat to their values. They want to control everything. And they use the police… to enforce their views.

OFFICER: Have you ever been involved in any political activities or protests against the government?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) No… not directly. I was afraid. But I supported the protests. I believed in… in freedom.

OFFICER RODRIGUEZ: (To applicant) Ms. Rodriguez, can you describe the specific types of derogatory names the police used when they harassed you?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter, looking down) They called me… "maricon." They called me… "travesti." They used… bad words. Words that… that hurt.

OFFICER: Ms. Rodriguez, do you have anything else you would like to add?
