OFFICER: Good morning, Ms. Rodriguez. My name is Officer Miller, and this is Officer Davis. We are Asylum Officers with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. This is a very important interview. We will be asking you questions about why you fear returning to El Salvador. I need you to answer all questions truthfully and to the best of your ability. Do you understand?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Maria Elena Rodriguez, January 10, 1985.

OFFICER: Thank you. Ms. Rodriguez, you are currently in removal proceedings, and you are requesting asylum as a defense against being deported back to El Salvador. Is that correct?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes, that is correct.

OFFICER: Okay. Let's start with some background information. Where in El Salvador were you born and raised?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I was born and raised in San Salvador.

OFFICER: And where did you live most recently before coming to the United States?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Still San Salvador. Always San Salvador.

OFFICER: Can you describe your neighborhood in San Salvador?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) It was… normal. Many houses, small streets. It was not… rich. But not the worst.

OFFICER: What is the highest level of education you completed?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I finished secondary school. High school.

OFFICER: Where did you attend high school?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) It was called… Escuela Nacional… I don’t remember the full name. It was a public school.

OFFICER: Do you have any documentation to prove you attended and completed secondary school?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) No, I… I lost it. When I left.

OFFICER: And what kind of work did you do in El Salvador?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I worked in a restaurant. As a waitress.

OFFICER: For how long did you work as a waitress?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Many years. Maybe… ten years? Off and on. Sometimes I would work in a different restaurant.

OFFICER: Can you provide the names of the restaurants where you worked?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Uh… there was… El Rincon. And… La Casita. And one other… I cannot remember the name now.

OFFICER: Okay. We will move on. You are claiming asylum based on your membership in a particular social group. Can you tell me about this group and why you fear persecution because of it?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes. It is… women. Women who are… alone. Single mothers.

OFFICER: So, you are saying that single mothers are persecuted in El Salvador?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes. The gangs… they see us as weak. They try to… control us. They want us to… to be with them. Or they want our sons to join them.

OFFICER: Can you give me specific examples of how you were personally threatened or harmed because you are a single mother?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes. One time… it was… May of 2022. Some men… I think they were from the MS-13… they came to my house. They said I needed to… to be with one of them. They said if I didn't, they would… take my son.

OFFICER: Did they identify themselves as MS-13?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) No, but everyone knows. They have the tattoos. They act like they own everything.

OFFICER: And what did you do when they came to your house?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I told them to leave. I said I didn't want anything to do with them.

OFFICER: And then what happened?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) They left. But they said they would be back.

OFFICER: Did you report this incident to the police?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) No. The police… they don't care. Or they are afraid. They cannot help.

OFFICER: Why do you say they don't care or are afraid? Have you had previous experiences with the police?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Everyone knows. It is… common knowledge.

OFFICER: But have *you* personally had negative experiences with the police that made you believe they wouldn’t help you?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) No… not directly. But my neighbor… she went to the police when her son was… threatened. The police did nothing.

OFFICER: After this incident in May 2022, did anything else happen?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes. They… they would come around. Not to my house exactly, but they would be on my street. Watching. Making me afraid.

OFFICER: How frequently would they come around?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Maybe… once a week? Sometimes more.

OFFICER: Did they ever speak to you again?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) No. They just… looked.

OFFICER: You said you have four children. How old are they?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) 17, 15, 12, and 8.

OFFICER: Are they all living with you here in the United States?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes, they are all here with me.

OFFICER: Are their fathers involved in their lives?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) No.

OFFICER: Why did you decide to leave El Salvador?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Because I was afraid for my children. I didn't want them to be… taken by the gangs. Or killed.

OFFICER: Did you try to relocate to another part of El Salvador to avoid the gangs?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) No. Where could I go? They are everywhere.

OFFICER: Are you familiar with other cities or regions in El Salvador where gang presence is less prevalent?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Maybe… but I have no family anywhere else. I have no money to start over somewhere new.

OFFICER: When did you leave El Salvador?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) July of 2023.

OFFICER: Can you describe your journey to the United States?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) It was… difficult. I paid a coyote. We traveled by bus. And walking. Through Guatemala and Mexico. It took many weeks.

OFFICER: How much did you pay the coyote?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) $8000.

OFFICER: Where did you get that money?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I… I saved it. And my sister… she helped me.

OFFICER: How much did you save, and how much did your sister give you?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I saved… maybe $2000. And my sister gave me the rest.

OFFICER: What does your sister do for a living?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) She works in a… a small shop. Selling clothes.

OFFICER: It seems like a significant amount of money for someone working in a small shop to give. Are you sure that’s where the money came from?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes. She wanted to help me.

OFFICER: How did you enter the United States?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) We crossed the border… near Texas.

OFFICER: Did you present yourself to immigration officials?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes.

OFFICER: What are your plans if you are granted asylum here in the United States?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I want to work. To take care of my children. I can work in a restaurant. I can clean houses. Anything.

OFFICER: Do you have any family members in the United States besides your children?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes, my sister. She lives in California.

OFFICER: Is she a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) She is… I think she is a resident.

OFFICER: Do you have any documents or evidence to support your asylum claim, such as police reports, medical records, or photos?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) No. I didn’t bring anything. I was too afraid to stay any longer.

OFFICER: In your asylum application, you mentioned that the gangs targeted you because you refused to pay them extortion money. You haven't mentioned that today. Can you explain that?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) (Hesitates) Uh… yes. They… they wanted me to pay them. But I didn’t have any money. So, they threatened me.

OFFICER: When did they ask you for extortion money?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) It was… before the incident at my house. Maybe… a month before.

OFFICER: So, you are saying that the gang members demanded money from you a month before they came to your house and pressured you to be with one of them?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes.

OFFICER: But in your testimony today, you stated that the gang members came to your house in May of 2022 and that was the first time you were approached by them. Can you explain this inconsistency?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) (Long pause) I… I am confused. It was a long time ago. Maybe I don't remember correctly.

OFFICER: Ms. Rodriguez, it’s important that you are truthful. Are you sure you are telling us everything that happened?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes. I am telling the truth. I am afraid to go back.

OFFICER: Okay. Let’s go back to your education. You mentioned you completed secondary school. Do you remember any specific subjects you studied?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Uh… Spanish. Math. History.

OFFICER: Do you remember what kind of math you studied? Algebra? Geometry?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) (Hesitates) Just… math.

OFFICER: And what are your children doing while you are here for this interview?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) They are with a friend.

OFFICER: Are your children in school here in the United States?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes.

OFFICER: Are they adjusting well?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) It is difficult. They don’t speak much English.

OFFICER: Ms. Rodriguez, is there anything else you would like to add or tell us that you think is important for us to know?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I just want to be safe. For me and my children. I cannot go back. They will kill us.

OFFICER: Thank you, Ms. Rodriguez. We have no further questions for you at this time. We will notify you of our decision in writing.
