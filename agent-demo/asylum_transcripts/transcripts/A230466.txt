OFFICER: Okay. You said you have a sister here. Is she a citizen or a legal permanent resident?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) She is a citizen. She became a citizen five years ago.

OFFICER: Thank you. Now, let’s talk about your education. You indicated on your application that you have a Master's degree. Can you tell me more about that?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes. I studied at the Universidad de El Salvador. I have a Master's degree in Education. I finished in 2012.

OFFICER: And what was your undergraduate degree in?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Bachelor's in Education, also from the Universidad de El Salvador.

OFFICER: Can you describe your area of focus within education? Did you specialize in a particular subject or age group?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) My focus was on curriculum development and educational policy. I was interested in how to improve the education system for all students, especially in underserved communities.

OFFICER: That’s interesting. So, after you finished your Master's degree, what kind of work did you do?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I worked as a teacher for several years, then I became a curriculum coordinator at a private school. I also volunteered with a non-profit organization that provided educational resources to children in poor neighborhoods.

OFFICER: You said you were a teacher and then a coordinator. Can you tell me the specific years you held each position?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I taught from 2012 until 2017. Then I was a coordinator from 2017 until… until I left El Salvador.

OFFICER: Until you left. Okay. Now, Ms. Rodriguez, the main reason you are here today is because you are seeking asylum. Can you tell me, in your own words, why you are afraid to return to El Salvador?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter, with noticeable distress) Because… because of the political situation and… and what happened to my brother.

OFFICER: Can you please explain that in more detail? What political situation are you referring to?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I… I supported the opposition party. I went to rallies, I volunteered. I believed they offered a better future for our country. The ruling party… they didn’t like that. And… and the gangs… they work with the ruling party.

OFFICER: So, you're saying you were politically active?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes, very active. I organized events, helped with fundraising. I believed in what we were doing.

OFFICER: Okay. And you mentioned something happened to your brother. What happened?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter, starting to cry) He… he was attacked. Because of my… my political activities. They… they thought he was involved too.

OFFICER: Can you tell me when this happened?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter, sobbing) It was… it was July 15, 2021.

OFFICER: July 15, 2021. Where did this happen?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Near his house. In San Salvador. He was walking home from work.

OFFICER: Can you describe the attack? What happened to your brother?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter, with difficulty) They… they beat him. Very badly. With… with pipes. He was in the hospital for… for a long time. They broke his leg and his arm. He had… head injuries.

OFFICER: Do you know who attacked him?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Everyone knows. It was the gang members. The *Mara Salvatrucha*. They are known to work for the ruling party, especially against opposition members.

OFFICER: Did your brother report the attack to the police?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) No. He was too afraid. The police… they are corrupt. They are often working with the gangs. He didn't trust them.

OFFICER: Did *you* report the attack to the police?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) No. I was afraid too. After that happened to my brother, I knew I was in danger. I started receiving threats.

OFFICER: What kind of threats? Can you be specific?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Phone calls. At first, they were just… warnings. Telling me to stop my political activities. Then they became more… more direct. They said they knew where I lived. They said they would hurt me and my family if I didn't stop.

OFFICER: Do you have any evidence of these threats? Phone records, text messages?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I… I deleted the messages. I was so scared. I changed my phone number.

OFFICER: I understand. Did you tell anyone about these threats?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes. I told my parents. And my sister here in the United States.

OFFICER: Okay. After your brother was attacked and you started receiving threats, what did you do?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I stopped going to the rallies. I stopped volunteering. But it wasn't enough. They… they kept watching me. I could feel it.

OFFICER: How could you feel it? Can you give me an example?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I would see the same men outside my house. They would follow me when I went to the market. They were always watching. One time, they stopped me on the street and told me to… to tell my brother he got off easy.

OFFICER: When was this?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) About a week after my brother was released from the hospital. So, late July, 2021.

OFFICER: So, you believe these threats and the attack on your brother were because of your political activities?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes. I am sure of it. I was targeted because I spoke out against the government.

OFFICER: Did you try to move to another part of El Salvador to get away from this danger?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I thought about it. But I was afraid they would find me. They have connections everywhere. And I didn't want to put my family in danger by moving them with me.

OFFICER: Why didn't you seek protection from the authorities? You said you didn't trust the police, but did you consider any other avenue?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I considered it, but a friend who works in the government warned me against it. He said that reporting it could actually make things worse, as the gangs have influence even within the government. He advised me to leave the country if I could.

OFFICER: And that's when you decided to come to the United States?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes. I knew I had to leave to protect myself and my family.

OFFICER: Can you tell me about your journey to the United States? When did you leave El Salvador, and how did you get here?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I left El Salvador on August 10, 2021. I traveled by bus to Guatemala, then to Mexico. It was a long and dangerous journey. I crossed the border into the United States near… near Tijuana on September 5, 2021.

OFFICER: How did you enter the United States?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I… I crossed the border without permission.

OFFICER: And what happened when you crossed the border?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I was apprehended by border patrol. I told them I was seeking asylum.

OFFICER: Ms. Rodriguez, do you have any documents or other evidence that support your claims?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I have pictures of my brother in the hospital after the attack. I also have some news articles about the political situation in El Salvador. My sister also has some of the threatening messages I sent her.

OFFICER: Are these documents included with your application?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes, I gave them to my lawyer.

OFFICER: Okay. Let’s talk about your family back in El Salvador. Do you believe they are still in danger because of your political activities and your asylum claim?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter, with tears in her eyes) Yes. I am very worried about them. The gangs know I am here. They know I am seeking asylum. I am afraid they will retaliate against my family.

OFFICER: What about your sister who is here in the United States? Do you think she is in danger?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I don't think so. She is a citizen. And she doesn't get involved in politics. But I worry about her too.

OFFICER: If you are granted asylum, what are your plans for the future?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I want to work. I want to contribute to this country. I am a teacher. I have a Master's degree. I can teach Spanish, or I can work with children. I want to build a new life here.

OFFICER: You mentioned that you have a Master's degree in Education. Have you considered how you might be able to use that here in the United States?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes. I have been researching the requirements for teaching in this country. I know I will need to get my credentials evaluated and possibly take some additional courses. I am willing to do whatever it takes to be able to work as a teacher again.

OFFICER: Do you speak any English?

APPLICANT: (In English, hesitantly) A little. I… I am learning.

OFFICER: (In English) Can you understand me when I speak slowly?

APPLICANT: (In English) Yes.

OFFICER: (In English) That's good. Keep practicing. It will help you a lot. (Through interpreter) Okay, we are almost finished. Is there anything else you would like to tell us? Anything at all that you think is important for us to know?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter, pleadingly) I just… I just want to be safe. I want my family to be safe. I cannot go back to El Salvador. They will kill me. Or hurt my family. Please, I am begging you, please grant me asylum.

OFFICER: Thank you, Ms. Rodriguez. We appreciate you sharing your story with us. We will carefully consider all of the evidence you have presented and make a decision in your case. We will notify you of our decision in writing. Do you have any questions for us?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) No, thank you.

OFFICER: Okay. This interview is concluded.
