INTERVIEW BEGINS

OFFICER: Good morning, Mr. Tesfaye. My name is Officer Miller, and I’m an asylum officer with USCIS. Thank you for coming in today. As you know, you have applied for asylum in the United States. The purpose of this interview is to determine whether you meet the legal requirements for asylum. I want to assure you that everything you say here today will be kept confidential unless disclosure is required by law. Do you understand?

APPLICANT: Yes, Officer, I understand. Thank you.

OFFICER: Before we begin, I need to swear you in. Please raise your right hand and repeat after me: “Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?”

APPLICANT: I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God.

OFFICER: Thank you. Please be seated. I have reviewed your application, Form I-589, Application for Asylum and for Withholding of Removal, and the supporting documents you submitted. We will be discussing the information you provided in detail. Please take your time and answer my questions as completely and honestly as possible. Do you understand?

APPLICANT: Yes, I understand.

OFFICER: Alright. Let's start with some background information. Could you please state your full name and date of birth for the record?

APPLICANT: My full name is Yohannes Tesfaye, and my date of birth is March 12, 1980.

OFFICER: And where were you born?

APPLICANT: I was born in Asmara, Eritrea.

OFFICER: Are you currently married? Do you have any children?

APPLICANT: No, Officer. I am not married, and I do not have any children.

OFFICER: Okay. Let's talk about your education. You indicated on your application that you completed secondary education. Can you tell me more about that? What school did you attend, and what subjects did you study?

APPLICANT: Yes. I attended Sawa Secondary School in Eritrea. It is… mandatory, you know, for all students. I studied… mostly sciences and mathematics. I was hoping to go to university for engineering, but… things changed.

OFFICER: Sawa Secondary School. That's also where the national service training takes place, correct?

APPLICANT: Yes, that is correct. The last year is military training.

OFFICER: How long did you attend Sawa Secondary School?

APPLICANT: Three years, Officer.

OFFICER: And what year did you graduate?

APPLICANT: I… I believe it was 2000. Or maybe 2001. It was a long time ago, I don't remember exactly.

OFFICER: Your application states 2001. Do you have any documentation, like a diploma or school transcript, to verify this?

APPLICANT: No, Officer. I… I left everything behind when I escaped. I didn't have time to collect those things.

OFFICER: I understand. Now, you mentioned you were hoping to study engineering. What kind of engineering were you interested in?

APPLICANT: Computer engineering, Officer. I was always fascinated by computers and technology. Even in Sawa, I would try to learn about them when I could.

OFFICER: Did you have access to computers at Sawa?

APPLICANT: Not really, Officer. There were some in the administration office, but we weren’t allowed to use them freely. I would try to… observe, ask questions when I could.

OFFICER: After completing your secondary education and the national service training, what did you do?

APPLICANT: I was assigned to work for the government in… in a telecommunications office.

OFFICER: What were your responsibilities there?

APPLICANT: Mostly… maintenance, some basic troubleshooting of the phone lines. Not really computer engineering, but… it was something related to technology.

OFFICER: How long did you work in that position?

APPLICANT: For… about ten years, I think. Maybe a little less. It was… indefinite service. We didn’t have a choice.

OFFICER: Okay. Now, let's move on to the reasons why you are seeking asylum in the United States. Your application states that you fear persecution in Eritrea based on your membership in a particular social group. Can you explain this in more detail? What is the social group, and why do you fear persecution because of it?

APPLICANT: Yes. The social group is… it's complicated. It’s… young men, like me, who are educated and want a better life than what Eritrea offers. We… we are seen as a threat to the government because we question their authority and want change. We are… targeted for being educated and ambitious.

OFFICER: So, it's a group of educated young men who desire a better life and are perceived as a threat by the government. Can you provide any specific examples of how this group is targeted or persecuted in Eritrea?

APPLICANT: Yes. We are… forced into indefinite national service, with little pay and no freedom. We are… monitored closely by the government. If we try to leave the country without permission, we are… arrested and imprisoned. Sometimes… worse. And it is not just the government. The… the people who support the government, they… they look down on us, call us names, accuse us of being traitors.

OFFICER: Can you tell me about a specific incident or incidents that led you to fear for your safety and ultimately leave Eritrea?

APPLICANT: Yes. About… two years ago, I was… approached by a government official. He… he told me that I was under suspicion of being involved in… anti-government activities. He said that I needed to… cooperate with them and provide information about others who were… critical of the government. I refused. I told him I didn't know anything. After that… things became very difficult. I was… constantly watched. My phone was tapped. I felt like I was being followed everywhere.

OFFICER: Can you give me the date of this incident with the government official?

APPLICANT: I… I don't remember the exact date, Officer. It was… sometime in 2020, I think. Maybe early 2021.

OFFICER: Do you remember the name of the official?

APPLICANT: No, Officer. He didn't tell me his name. He was… just a man in a suit. Very… intimidating.

OFFICER: You said you were constantly watched after this incident. Can you describe how you were watched?

APPLICANT: I would… see the same people near my house, near my work. They would… stare at me. Sometimes, they would… follow me in their cars. I felt like I couldn't go anywhere without being watched.

OFFICER: Did you report this to the police or any other authorities?

APPLICANT: No, Officer. The police are… part of the government. They would not help me. They would probably arrest me instead.

OFFICER: Did anything else happen to you personally that made you fear for your safety?

APPLICANT: Yes. One night… I was walking home from work, and I was… attacked by a group of men. They… they beat me badly. They said I was a… traitor to the country. They told me to… stop questioning the government.

OFFICER: When did this attack occur?

APPLICANT: This was… about six months after the incident with the government official. So, maybe… late 2021.

OFFICER: Where did this attack take place?

APPLICANT: It was… on a street near my house in Asmara. It was… late at night, and there were no other people around.

OFFICER: Did you recognize any of the men who attacked you?

APPLICANT: No, Officer. They were… strangers. They were wearing… regular clothes.

OFFICER: Did you report this attack to the police?

APPLICANT: No, Officer. I was… too afraid. I knew they would not help me.

OFFICER: You stated you were a victim of trafficking. Can you explain the circumstances surrounding this?

APPLICANT: Yes. After the attack, I knew I had to leave Eritrea. I contacted… someone who could help me escape. I paid them… a lot of money. They… promised to take me to Sudan. But… they didn't. They took me to… a camp in the desert. There were… many other people there, mostly Eritreans and Ethiopians. We were… treated very badly. We were… forced to work for them. We were… starved and beaten. They… demanded more money from our families.

OFFICER: How long were you held in this camp?

APPLICANT: For… about three months, I think. It was… a terrible experience.

OFFICER: How did you escape from the camp?

APPLICANT: I… I was very lucky. One night, there was… a fight between the traffickers. In the confusion, I was able to… escape with a few other people. We… walked for days in the desert until we reached a town.

OFFICER: And after you escaped the camp, where did you go?

APPLICANT: We… went to Khartoum, Sudan. I stayed there for a few months, trying to… find a way to get to the United States.

OFFICER: How did you eventually travel to the United States?

APPLICANT: I… I paid another person to help me get a… a fake passport and a plane ticket. I flew to… Mexico, and then I crossed the border into the United States.

OFFICER: What documents did you use to enter the United States?

APPLICANT: I used a… a passport from… I don’t remember which country. It was not my real passport.

OFFICER: You said you have no family members at risk in Eritrea. Are you sure?

APPLICANT: Yes, Officer. My parents… they passed away a long time ago. I have no siblings. No close relatives.

OFFICER: You mentioned working in telecommunications. What specific skills do you have that you could use here in the United States?

APPLICANT: I… I know a lot about phone systems, about… troubleshooting technical problems. I am… quick to learn new things. I am confident that I could find a job in… in the technology sector.

OFFICER: Have you ever been arrested or convicted of a crime in any country?

APPLICANT: No, Officer. Never.

OFFICER: Are you now or have you ever been a member of any political party or organization?

APPLICANT: No, Officer.

OFFICER: Mr. Tesfaye, I have a few concerns about your testimony. Firstly, you couldn't recall the exact date of the incident with the government official or the name of the official, despite it being a pivotal event that triggered your fear of persecution. Secondly, you mentioned an attack, but did not report it to the police, which seems unusual given the severity of the assault. Furthermore, your recollection of the year you graduated from Sawa Secondary School was initially hesitant, and you lacked any documentation to support your educational claims. Finally, you mentioned that you have no family, but your application lists an aunt, Senait Mehari, still residing in Asmara. Can you explain these inconsistencies?

APPLICANT: Officer, I… I was very traumatized by these events. My memory is not perfect. I… I was afraid to report the attack to the police because I knew they would not help me. And… about my aunt… I haven't seen her in many years. We are not… close. I didn't think she was… important to mention.

OFFICER: But she is listed on your application as family. Also, you stated that you possess computer engineering skills, but your work history describes basic telecommunications maintenance. Can you explain the disparity in your skills and professional experience?

APPLICANT: I… I learned what I could on my own. I wanted to study engineering, but I didn't have the opportunity. But I am still… skilled. I can learn quickly.

OFFICER: Okay, Mr. Tesfaye. Do you have any other documents or information that you would like to provide at this time?

APPLICANT: No, Officer. I have told you everything.

OFFICER: Do you have any questions for me?

APPLICANT: No, Officer. Thank you for your time.

OFFICER: Thank you for coming in today, Mr. Tesfaye. I will now be preparing a recommendation on your case. You will receive a written decision in the mail.
