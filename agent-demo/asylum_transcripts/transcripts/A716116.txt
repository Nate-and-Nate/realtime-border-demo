INTERVIEW BEGINS

OFFICER: Good morning, Mr. Li. My name is Officer Miller, and I am an asylum officer with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Today, I will be interviewing you regarding your application for asylum in the United States. Please understand that I am required to ask you questions to determine whether you meet the legal requirements for asylum. Do you understand?

APPLICANT: Yes, Officer Miller. I understand.

OFFICER: Before we begin, I need to swear you in. Please raise your right hand and repeat after me: “Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?”

APPLICANT: I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God.

OFFICER: Thank you. Please be seated. For the record, could you please state your full name and date of birth?

APPLICANT: My name is Li Wei. My date of birth is March 8, 2001.

OFFICER: Thank you. Mr. Li, I have reviewed your application for asylum, Form I-589. It indicates that you are seeking asylum based on a fear of persecution in China due to your race. Is that correct?

APPLICANT: Yes, that is correct.

OFFICER: Okay. Let's start with some background questions. Could you please tell me about your education?

APPLICANT: I… I finished primary school. Just the basic, you know?

OFFICER: So, you completed six years of primary education?

APPLICANT: Yes, six years. After that, I… I started working.

OFFICER: I see. And what kind of work did you do? Your application mentions government/military experience. Can you elaborate on that?

APPLICANT: Yes. After primary school, I… I joined the People's Liberation Army. It was… mandatory. You have to do it.

OFFICER: How long were you in the military?

APPLICANT: Almost four years.

OFFICER: What was your role in the military? What kind of training did you receive?

APPLICANT: I was… a soldier. Basic training. Rifle training. Marching. Guard duty. Things like that.

OFFICER: Did you have any specialized training or responsibilities? Your application doesn't provide much detail.

APPLICANT: No, no special training. Just… regular soldier stuff.

OFFICER: Alright. Now, let's move on to the reasons why you left China. Your application states that you fear persecution based on your race. Could you please tell me more about this? What specific race are you referring to?

APPLICANT: I am… Han Chinese.

OFFICER: You are Han Chinese. And you fear persecution *because* you are Han Chinese? This is… unusual. Could you explain?

APPLICANT: Yes… it's… complicated. The government… they are watching us. Always. Even Han Chinese.

OFFICER: Watching you? In what way?

APPLICANT: They are… controlling everything. What we say, what we do. They are building… a system. To control everyone.

OFFICER: Can you provide specific examples of how *you* were personally affected by this control?

APPLICANT: Well… in my village… everyone… everyone had to… attend meetings. Political meetings. We had to… praise the government. And… we had to report on each other.

OFFICER: This sounds like standard political indoctrination. How does this relate to persecution based on your race?

APPLICANT: Because… the government… they are using technology… to track us. They know everything about us. They know… who we talk to, where we go. It’s all based on… our… our citizen ID. Which is… tied to our race. They can track Han Chinese specifically.

OFFICER: But every citizen has a citizen ID, regardless of race. Are you saying the government treats Han Chinese differently than other ethnic groups in China?

APPLICANT: Yes… and no. They… they say everyone is equal. But… they are always watching.

OFFICER: Can you provide a specific instance where you were discriminated against or harmed *because* you are Han Chinese?

APPLICANT: Well… my neighbor… he… he was arrested.

OFFICER: What was he arrested for?

APPLICANT: For… speaking out against the government. He said… things… online.

OFFICER: And you believe this happened because he was Han Chinese?

APPLICANT: Yes… because… they are watching all of us. Especially if you speak out.

OFFICER: Mr. Li, it sounds like your neighbor was arrested for criticizing the government. That is a political issue. Your asylum claim is based on *race*. I'm not seeing a connection.

APPLICANT: But… but the government… they are targeting *everyone*.

OFFICER: I understand your concern about government surveillance and control. However, your claim is based on racial persecution. Do you have any evidence that you, specifically, were targeted or harmed because you are Han Chinese?

APPLICANT: No… I… I don’t have… direct evidence. But I was afraid. I saw what happened to my neighbor. I knew it could happen to me.

OFFICER: Did you ever report this fear to the police or any other authority?

APPLICANT: No. I was afraid to.

OFFICER: Did you consider moving to a different part of China to avoid this alleged persecution?

APPLICANT: No. The government… they are everywhere. They control everything. It's the same everywhere in China.

OFFICER: Let's talk about your travel to the United States. How did you arrive here?

APPLICANT: I came… by plane. From Beijing.

OFFICER: And you had a valid visa?

APPLICANT: Yes. A tourist visa.

OFFICER: When did you arrive?

APPLICANT: August 15, 2022.

OFFICER: And you filed your asylum application on September 10, 2022. What changed between August 15th and September 10th that made you decide to seek asylum?

APPLICANT: I… I started reading… about the… the situation in China. Online. And I realized… I couldn’t go back.

OFFICER: What specifically did you read that made you believe you would be persecuted if you returned?

APPLICANT: Articles… about… about the government… controlling everything. And… about… people being arrested.

OFFICER: Can you provide me with the names of these articles or websites?

APPLICANT: I… I don’t remember. I just… read them online.

OFFICER: Mr. Li, you stated earlier that your entire village was forced to attend political meetings. If this was happening, why did you wait until you arrived in the United States to research the political situation? It seems like you would have been aware of this long before you left China.

APPLICANT: I… I didn’t… I didn’t understand. I just… followed the rules. I didn’t know… it was wrong. Until I came here.

OFFICER: Your application mentions a dependent family member. Who is this?

APPLICANT: My mother.

OFFICER: Is she currently in China?

APPLICANT: Yes.

OFFICER: Is she also facing persecution?

APPLICANT: I… I don’t know. But she is… old. And… she needs me.

OFFICER: If you were granted asylum, what are your plans for the future? What kind of work would you do?

APPLICANT: I… I don’t know. I have… basic skills. From the army. I can… follow orders.

OFFICER: Your background is in the military. Considering your limited education, how do you plan to support yourself and your mother in the United States?

APPLICANT: I… I will find work. Any work. I am… a hard worker.

OFFICER: Are you aware that if you are granted asylum, you would eventually be eligible to apply for permanent residency and then citizenship?

APPLICANT: Yes.

OFFICER: Are you familiar with the requirements for naturalization?

APPLICANT: I… I think so.

OFFICER: The oath of allegiance requires you to renounce allegiance to any foreign power. Are you willing to do that?

APPLICANT: Yes.

OFFICER: Mr. Li, I have some concerns about your credibility. You claim to fear persecution based on your race, but you haven't provided any specific examples of how you, personally, were targeted or discriminated against. Your account of why you waited until you arrived in the United States to research the political situation in China seems inconsistent with your earlier statements about being forced to attend political meetings in your village. And your plans for the future are vague, given your limited education and work experience. Do you have any additional information or evidence that you would like to provide to support your claim?

APPLICANT: I… I just want to be safe. I don’t want to go back to China.

OFFICER: I understand. I have no further questions for you at this time. I will review your application and the information you have provided, and you will receive a decision in the mail. Do you have any questions for me?

APPLICANT: No. Thank you, Officer Miller.

OFFICER: Thank you, Mr. Li. This interview is concluded.
