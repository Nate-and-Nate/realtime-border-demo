INTERVIEW BEGINS

OFFICER: Good morning. My name is Officer Miller, and this is a credible fear interview. With me today is Ms. Eleanor Vance, your attorney. Before we begin, I need to swear you in. Please raise your right hand. Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

APPLICANT: I do.

OFFICER: Thank you. For the record, please state your full name and date of birth.

APPLICANT: My name is Maria Rodriguez, and my date of birth is June 10, 1969.

OFFICER: Thank you, Ms. Rodriguez. Ms. Vance, do you have any preliminary comments before we begin?

ATTORNEY: No, Officer, thank you.

OFFICER: Ms. Rodriguez, can you please tell me why you left Honduras and why you are afraid to return?

APPLICANT: (Hesitates) Well, it's... it's complicated. It's because of my... my political opinions and because I'm non-binary. I was… I was targeted.

OFFICER: Can you elaborate on what political opinions you hold and how they led to you being targeted?

APPLICANT: I… I supported the opposition party. I went to some rallies, you know, small ones. And I posted things on Facebook, mostly just sharing articles and commenting. Nothing too crazy.

OFFICER: What kind of articles were you sharing and what kind of comments were you making?

APPLICANT: Articles about corruption, about the government not doing enough for the people. And I would just comment things like, "This is wrong," or "We need change."

OFFICER: And how did this lead to you being targeted?

APPLICANT: After a few months, I started getting… messages. Online. Threats. People saying things like, “We know who you are,” and “You should be careful what you say.” And then, one night…

OFFICER: Yes?

APPLICANT: One night, I was walking home from work, it was late, maybe around 11 pm, and two men… they stopped me. They knew my name. They told me to stop spreading lies about the government, that I was a disgrace. They… (voice cracks) they pushed me around a bit.

OFFICER: Did they physically harm you?

APPLICANT: Yes, they… they shoved me to the ground. One of them kicked me. It wasn't… wasn't serious, just bruises. But it was scary.

OFFICER: Did you report this to the police?

APPLICANT: No.

OFFICER: Why not?

APPLICANT: (Hesitates) Because… because the police are corrupt. They're in on it. I didn't think they would help me. I thought it would make things worse.

OFFICER: Can you give me a specific example of how the police are corrupt in relation to political dissidents?

APPLICANT: (Pause) Well, everyone knows it. It’s just… common knowledge. I didn’t personally see it, but you hear stories. People who speak out against the government disappear, and the police do nothing.

OFFICER: You said you were also targeted because you are non-binary. Can you explain that?

APPLICANT: Yes. Being non-binary in Honduras is… difficult. There’s a lot of discrimination. People stare, they make comments. It's not safe.

OFFICER: Can you provide a specific instance of discrimination or violence you experienced due to your gender identity?

APPLICANT: (Looks down) Well, it's mostly just… harassment. People calling me names, making fun of me. I haven't been… physically attacked for that reason, not directly.

OFFICER: So, the physical attack you described earlier was related to your political opinions, not your gender identity?

APPLICANT: Yes, that's right.

OFFICER: You said you have a Bachelor's degree. What did you study?

APPLICANT: Business Administration.

OFFICER: And you work in the service industry?

APPLICANT: Yes, I was a bartender.

OFFICER: How long were you a bartender?

APPLICANT: For about five years. Before that, I worked in a call center.

OFFICER: How long did you work in the call center?

APPLICANT: About two years.

OFFICER: So you have a degree in Business Administration but worked as a bartender and in a call center. Why didn't you pursue a job more directly related to your field of study?

APPLICANT: (Shrugs) It's hard to find work in Honduras. The economy is bad. The call center job paid okay, but it was stressful. Bartending was easier, more flexible.

OFFICER: Did you ever try to find a job in business administration? Did you send out resumes, attend interviews?

APPLICANT: I… I sent out a few resumes, but I didn't get any responses. I gave up after a while.

OFFICER: You mentioned posting articles on Facebook. Do you have any of those posts saved? Can you provide any evidence of your political activity?

APPLICANT: No, I deleted everything. I was scared.

OFFICER: When did you delete these posts?

APPLICANT: Right after the… the attack.

OFFICER: So, you deleted the posts but continued to work as a bartender, knowing that you could be targeted again walking home late at night?

APPLICANT: (Hesitates) I… I needed the money. I didn't have any other options.

OFFICER: Did you consider moving to a different part of Honduras, perhaps a safer area?

APPLICANT: Yes, I thought about it. But I didn't have the money to move. And I didn't know where to go. The whole country is dangerous.

OFFICER: You mentioned family. Do you have any family members who are also at risk?

APPLICANT: Yes, my mother. She’s elderly and depends on me. She also holds similar political opinions.

OFFICER: Has she been threatened or attacked?

APPLICANT: No, not directly. But she's scared. She worries about me.

OFFICER: Is she included in your asylum application?

APPLICANT: Yes.

OFFICER: You traveled to the United States. Can you describe your journey?

APPLICANT: I… I paid a coyote. I traveled with a group of people. It was very dangerous. We walked for days, through the desert.

OFFICER: What route did you take?

APPLICANT: (Pause) I don't know exactly. The coyote led us. We crossed the border somewhere in Texas.

OFFICER: Do you remember the city or town closest to where you crossed the border?

APPLICANT: (Shakes head) No, I don't remember the name.

OFFICER: How long did the journey take?

APPLICANT: About three weeks.

OFFICER: And you entered the United States without authorization?

APPLICANT: Yes.

OFFICER: What are your plans if you are granted asylum in the United States?

APPLICANT: I want to work. I want to contribute to society. I could… maybe I could work in a bar again, or… I don't know. Maybe I could find something related to my degree.

OFFICER: Do you have any specific skills or experience from your degree that you think would be valuable here?

APPLICANT: (Thinks for a moment) I… I learned about accounting, marketing, things like that. But I haven't used those skills in a long time.

OFFICER: Ms. Rodriguez, you mentioned being non-binary. Have you sought any medical treatment or counseling related to your gender identity?

APPLICANT: No, I haven't. It's not something I've been able to afford.

OFFICER: Do you have any documentation to support your claim of being non-binary, such as letters from friends, or photos expressing your gender identity?

APPLICANT: No, I don't. I didn't think to bring anything like that.

OFFICER: Ms. Vance, do you have any questions for your client?

ATTORNEY: Yes, Officer. Maria, can you describe the messages you received online in more detail? What specific phrases did they use?

APPLICANT: (Hesitates) They said… they said things like, “We’re watching you,” and “You’re going to regret this.” They called me names… “traitor,” “communist.”

ATTORNEY: And can you describe the men who attacked you? What did they look like?

APPLICANT: They were… tall, muscular. They were wearing dark clothes. I couldn't see their faces clearly. It was dark.

ATTORNEY: Thank you, Maria. I have no further questions at this time, Officer.

OFFICER: Ms. Rodriguez, you stated that you deleted your Facebook posts out of fear. However, you continued to work as a bartender and walk home late at night, which seems to contradict that fear. Can you explain this discrepancy?

APPLICANT: (Looks down) I… I don't know. I was scared, but I also needed to work. I didn't think they would attack me again. I thought maybe they were just trying to scare me.

OFFICER: Is there anything else you would like to add?

APPLICANT: I just… I just want to be safe. I don't want to go back to Honduras.

OFFICER: Thank you, Ms. Rodriguez. This concludes the interview. We will notify you of our decision in writing.
