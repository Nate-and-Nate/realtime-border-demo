INTERVIEW BEGINS

OFFICER: Good morning, Ms. Fatima. My name is Officer Miller, and my employee number is AO-3211. I am an asylum officer with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. This is an interview to determine if you qualify for asylum in the United States. Do you understand?

APPLICANT: Yes, Officer. I understand.

OFFICER: Before we begin, I need to place you under oath. Please raise your right hand and repeat after me: "I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God."

APPLICANT: I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God.

OFFICER: Thank you. Please be seated. Now, Ms. Fatima, you filed Form I-589, Application for Asylum and for Withholding of Removal, on June 12th, 2022. Is that correct?

APPLICANT: Yes, that is correct.

OFFICER: In your application, you state that you are seeking asylum based on a fear of persecution in Iraq due to your membership in a particular social group. Is that correct?

APPLICANT: Yes, exactly.

OFFICER: Okay. Ms. Fatima, can you please tell me your full name and date of birth for the record?

APPLICANT: My full name is Fatima Khalil Al-Najjar, and my date of birth is March 10th, 1970.

OFFICER: And what is your current address in the United States?

APPLICANT: It’s 14 Oak Street, Apartment 2B, Anytown, USA.

OFFICER: Thank you. Let’s start with your background. Where in Iraq were you born and raised?

APPLICANT: I was born and raised in Baghdad.

OFFICER: And can you tell me about your education?

APPLICANT: I finished secondary school, you know, high school. I got my diploma.

OFFICER: What year did you graduate?

APPLICANT: I believe it was 1988. Maybe 1989. I don’t remember exactly.

OFFICER: Do you have any official documentation of your graduation? A diploma, perhaps?

APPLICANT: No, Officer. I left everything when I came to America. It was too dangerous to bring many things. I had to be fast.

OFFICER: I understand. And after high school, what did you do?

APPLICANT: I went to work. My family needed money.

OFFICER: What kind of work did you do?

APPLICANT: I worked in construction. My father was a builder, and he taught me a lot. I learned how to lay bricks, plaster, some plumbing, electrical… general handyman work, really.

OFFICER: Did you have any formal training in these areas, or was it all on-the-job experience?

APPLICANT: Mostly on-the-job. My father showed me everything. I helped him since I was a young girl.

OFFICER: So you've been working in construction for a considerable amount of time?

APPLICANT: Yes, since I was very young. Over 30 years.

OFFICER: In your application, you mentioned working with Allied forces. Can you elaborate on that?

APPLICANT: Yes. After 2003, when the Americans came, I sometimes got work doing repairs on some of their buildings. Small things, you know? Fixing walls, things like that. My English was better than most, so they liked to hire me.

OFFICER: Can you provide any specific examples of projects you worked on, including dates and locations, and for which Allied force?

APPLICANT: It was mostly at a base… near the Green Zone. I don’t remember the exact name of the base. And the dates… it was on and off between 2004 and maybe 2007. Small jobs, you know? The American soldiers hired me. I don’t know which unit specifically. They just needed someone to fix things.

OFFICER: Do you have any documentation to support this claim of working with Allied forces? Pay stubs, letters of recommendation, anything?

APPLICANT: No, Officer. It was all cash. And, you know, things were very chaotic then. Nobody kept good records.

OFFICER: I understand. Now, let’s talk about the reasons you left Iraq. In your application, you stated that you fear persecution because you belong to a particular social group. Can you tell me more about that?

APPLICANT: Yes. It is because I am… a woman, working in construction, and I helped the Americans. All these things together made me a target.

OFFICER: Can you explain specifically how these factors made you a target?

APPLICANT: Well, in my neighborhood, the men didn’t like seeing a woman doing a man’s job. They said it was shameful. And then, working with the Americans… that made me a traitor in their eyes. They called me names, threatened me…

OFFICER: Can you give me specific examples of these threats?

APPLICANT: Yes. One time, a group of men stopped me on the street. They yelled at me, called me a “whore” and a “collaborator.” They said I should be ashamed of myself and that I would pay for my sins. They pushed me, and I fell.

OFFICER: When did this incident occur?

APPLICANT: It was… maybe in 2006. I think. I’m not exactly sure. It was a long time ago.

OFFICER: Where did this happen?

APPLICANT: It was near my house, in the market.

OFFICER: Did you report this incident to the police?

APPLICANT: No. What was the point? The police were often just as bad. They wouldn’t help me.

OFFICER: Were there any other incidents?

APPLICANT: Yes. Many times, men would shout things at me as I walked by. One time, someone threw a rock at my house and broke a window. And then, in 2008, things got really bad.

OFFICER: What happened in 2008?

APPLICANT: My brother… he was killed.

OFFICER: I’m sorry to hear that. How did he die?

APPLICANT: He was… he was shot. In the street. They said it was a robbery, but I think it was because of me. Because of my work with the Americans.

OFFICER: Who do you believe shot your brother?

APPLICANT: I don’t know for sure. But I think it was some of the same men who threatened me before. They wanted to punish me.

OFFICER: Did you report your brother’s death to the police?

APPLICANT: Yes, of course. But they didn’t do anything. They just said it was a random act of violence.

OFFICER: After your brother’s death, what did you do?

APPLICANT: I was terrified. I knew I had to leave. I sold everything I had and made plans to come to America.

OFFICER: Did you try to relocate to another part of Iraq before leaving the country? Perhaps a safer area?

APPLICANT: No. I didn’t think it would help. They could find me anywhere. They knew who I was.

OFFICER: What makes you so sure they could find you anywhere? Did they explicitly state this?

APPLICANT: No, not explicitly. But I just knew. Everyone in my neighborhood knew what I did. Word gets around.

OFFICER: Let’s talk about your travel to the United States. When did you leave Iraq?

APPLICANT: I left in March of 2022.

OFFICER: What route did you take to the United States?

APPLICANT: I flew to Turkey, then to Mexico, and then I crossed the border.

OFFICER: How did you cross the border?

APPLICANT: I… I paid someone to help me.

OFFICER: Did you enter the United States legally?

APPLICANT: I… no. I crossed without permission.

OFFICER: Okay. You stated you have family. How many dependents are on your application?

APPLICANT: There are four of us total. My husband and two children.

OFFICER: Are they currently in the United States?

APPLICANT: Yes, they are here with me.

OFFICER: Are they also seeking asylum?

APPLICANT: Yes, they are on my application.

OFFICER: Are they also at risk in Iraq?

APPLICANT: Yes, of course. They are my family. If they hurt me, they will hurt them too. My husband supported my work; he is also seen as a traitor.

OFFICER: You mentioned you are a woman in construction. Are there no other women that work in construction in Iraq?

APPLICANT: There are very few. It is not a job for women, according to many people. But I am strong and I needed to work.

OFFICER: And you believe this is the main reason for the threats?

APPLICANT: It is part of it. But it is also because I worked with the Americans. It is all connected.

OFFICER: If granted asylum, what are your plans for the future in the United States?

APPLICANT: I want to work. I want to use my skills to build a new life for my family. I can do construction work. I can fix houses. I am a hard worker.

OFFICER: You mentioned your English is better than most. How did you learn English?

APPLICANT: I learned it in school. And I practiced with the American soldiers.

OFFICER: I noticed that you did not seek help from any non-governmental organizations after the threats you received. Why is that?

APPLICANT: I did not trust anyone. I was afraid that they would be working with the people who were threatening me. Also, I did not know about any of these organizations.

OFFICER: Ms. Fatima, I have a few concerns about your testimony. Firstly, you mentioned working with the Allied forces between 2004 and 2007, but you couldn't recall specific details about the projects or the units you worked with. Given the severity of the alleged threats against you due to this association, it is unusual that you lack specific recollections. Secondly, your brother's death is tragic, but you only *think* it was connected to your work. You don't have concrete evidence, and the police report stated it was a robbery. Lastly, you state that you did not relocate internally because they could find you anywhere, but you did not receive any direct threats indicating you would be hunted down. Therefore, it is unclear how they would be able to find you wherever you went.

APPLICANT: Officer, I understand your concerns. It has been a long time. I try not to remember the bad things. I just want to protect my family. As for my brother, I know in my heart that it was because of me. And maybe it is true that I assumed they could find me, but I was very scared.

OFFICER: Ms. Fatima, do you have any other evidence you would like to submit at this time?

APPLICANT: No, Officer. I have given you everything.

OFFICER: Okay. Ms. Fatima, do you have any questions for me?

APPLICANT: No, thank you, Officer.

OFFICER: This concludes the interview. You will receive a written decision in the mail. Please keep your address updated with USCIS. Thank you for your time.
