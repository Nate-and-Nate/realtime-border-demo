INTERVIEW BEGINS

OFFICER: Good morning, Mr. Khan. My name is Officer Miller, and this is Officer Davis. We are asylum officers with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. This interview is to determine if you are eligible for asylum in the United States. I need to explain the process to you and administer an oath. Do you understand?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Uh... near the... the big market. The central market.

OFFICER: Can you give me a more specific address or neighborhood?

OFFICER: What was your occupation in Afghanistan?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I worked at a... a small clinic. A private clinic.

OFFICER: What was the name of the clinic?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) (Long pause) Uh... I... I don't remember the name. It was a long time ago.

OFFICER: What is your educational background?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I finished secondary school. High school.

OFFICER: Did you receive any additional training to become a medical assistant?

OFFICER: Okay. Now, let's talk about why you left Afghanistan. What are you afraid of?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I am afraid of the Taliban. They are very bad.

OFFICER: Can you explain why you are afraid of the Taliban? What specific actions have they taken that make you fear them?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) They... they hurt people. They kill people. They don't like... people like me.

OFFICER: What do you mean, "people like you"?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) (Looks down) I am... just a normal man. But the Taliban... they think... I am not... good enough.

OFFICER: Are you a member of a particular ethnic or religious group that is targeted by the Taliban?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) No. I am... Sunni Muslim. Like most people in Afghanistan.

OFFICER: So, why do you believe the Taliban would target you specifically?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) (Hesitates) Because... because I helped people. I helped sick people. The Taliban... they don't like that. They think only they can decide who gets help.

OFFICER: Can you give me a specific instance where the Taliban threatened you or harmed someone you know because of your work as a medical assistant?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) (Long pause) One time... a man came to the clinic. He was hurt. He needed help. I helped him. Later... the Taliban came looking for him. They asked me if I had seen him. I said no. They got angry. They said I was helping the enemy.

OFFICER: When did this happen? Can you give me a date or an approximate timeframe?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Maybe... two years ago. Before I left.

OFFICER: What happened after the Taliban questioned you?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) They... they warned me. They said if I helped anyone like that again, they would punish me.

OFFICER: Did they physically harm you at that time?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) No. They just... warned me.

OFFICER: Did you report this incident to the police or any other authorities?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) No. The police... they are afraid of the Taliban too.

OFFICER: Did you continue working at the clinic after this incident?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes... for a little while. But I was scared.

OFFICER: Why did you not relocate to another part of Afghanistan where you might be safer?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) (Shrugs) I... I don't have family anywhere else. And the Taliban... they are everywhere.

OFFICER: So, you said this incident happened about two years ago. Why did you wait so long to leave Afghanistan?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I was hoping things would get better. But they didn't. They got worse.

OFFICER: Can you describe how they got worse? Can you provide any further incidents or threats?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) (Hesitates) I... I heard stories. About people being killed. About people being punished for small things. I was afraid it would happen to me.

OFFICER: Can you tell me about your family? Do you have a wife, children, or other relatives in Afghanistan?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I have a wife and four children. They are still in Afghanistan.

OFFICER: Are they in danger because of you?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) (Looks worried) I think so. If the Taliban find out I am here... asking for asylum... they might hurt them.

OFFICER: Do you have any evidence to support your claim that the Taliban is interested in you or your family? Any documents, photographs, or other items?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) No. I didn't bring anything like that. I was afraid to.

OFFICER: How did you travel to the United States?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I flew. From Kabul to... to Dubai. Then from Dubai to... to Mexico. Then I crossed the border.

OFFICER: When did you enter the United States?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) About... six months ago.

OFFICER: What kind of visa did you use to enter Dubai and Mexico?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I had a tourist visa. Someone helped me get it.

OFFICER: Do you know who helped you get the visa?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) (Looks uncomfortable) It was a friend. He helped me. I paid him.

OFFICER: How much did you pay him?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) A lot of money.

OFFICER: Can you be more specific?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Maybe... five thousand dollars.

OFFICER: Where did you get that kind of money?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I... I saved it. Over many years.

OFFICER: Mr. Khan, you stated you worked as a medical assistant at a clinic, but you cannot recall the name of the clinic. You also mentioned saving $5,000, but you also said you were afraid of the Taliban and implied you lived a modest life. Can you explain this?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) (Stammers) The clinic... it was a small clinic. I just... I forget the name. And the money... I saved it slowly. Little by little.

OFFICER: What are your plans if you are granted asylum in the United States?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I want to work. I want to help people. I can work as a medical assistant again.

OFFICER: Your English is limited. How do you plan to communicate with patients and doctors?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I will learn English. I will study hard.

OFFICER: Have you started taking English classes since arriving in the United States?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) No. Not yet.

OFFICER: Mr. Khan, you said you have four children in Afghanistan. What are their ages?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) The oldest is... 25. The youngest is... 16.

OFFICER: Your oldest child is 25. Why didn't they accompany you to the United States?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) They... they couldn't. It was too expensive. And they have their own lives.

OFFICER: What is your wife's name?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Fatima.

OFFICER: Do you have any documents to prove your marriage, such as a marriage certificate?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) No. I didn't bring it.

OFFICER: One last question, Mr. Khan. In your application, you stated that you were a well-known and respected member of your community. However, you also claim to have been targeted by the Taliban for helping a wounded man. If you were well-known and respected, wouldn't you have more protection from the community? And wouldn't helping someone in need be seen as a positive thing by the community, rather than something that would attract the attention of the Taliban?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) (Looks down, avoids eye contact) I... I don't know. Maybe... maybe I was wrong.

OFFICER: Mr. Khan, do you have anything else you would like to add?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) No. Thank you.

OFFICER: Thank you for your time, Mr. Khan. We will review your case and notify you of our decision.
