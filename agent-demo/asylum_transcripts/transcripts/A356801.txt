INTERVIEW BEGINS

OFFICER: Good morning, Mr. Ramirez. My name is Officer Miller, and this is an interview to determine your eligibility for asylum in the United States. I need to inform you that you are not required to answer any questions, but your refusal to answer may affect your application. Do you understand?

APPLICANT: Yes, I understand.

OFFICER: Please raise your right hand and repeat after me: "I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God."

APPLICANT: I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God.

OFFICER: Thank you. Please be seated. For the record, you are not represented by an attorney today. Is that correct?

APPLICANT: Yes, that is correct. I… I could not afford one.

OFFICER: Understood. We will proceed without legal representation. I have reviewed your Form I-589, Application for Asylum and Withholding of Removal. I'll be asking you questions about the information you provided, as well as some additional questions to get a clearer picture of your situation. Please answer all questions truthfully and to the best of your ability. Are you ready to begin?

APPLICANT: Yes, I am ready.

OFFICER: Let's start with some background information. Your application states you are a 22-year-old male citizen of Guatemala. Is that correct?

APPLICANT: Yes, that is correct.

OFFICER: And you are seeking asylum based on fear of persecution due to your sexual orientation, is that also correct?

APPLICANT: Yes, that is the reason.

OFFICER: Can you tell me about your life in Guatemala before you came to the United States? Where did you live? What was your family life like?

APPLICANT: I lived in Guatemala City, in Zone 10. I grew up there with my parents and two brothers and two sisters. It was… a normal family, I think. My father, he worked construction, like me, later. My mother, she stayed home to take care of us.

OFFICER: You mentioned working in construction. Your application states you have a Bachelor's degree. Can you explain that?

APPLICANT: Yes, I studied architecture at the Universidad de San Carlos. I finished my degree, but… it was hard to find work as an architect. Especially, well… because of who I am. People in the construction industry, they are very… *macho*. So, I ended up working with my father, doing more general construction.

OFFICER: So you have both formal education in architecture and practical experience in construction.

APPLICANT: Yes, that is right. I can read blueprints, design things, but also, I can build things with my hands.

OFFICER: That’s good to know. Let's talk about why you left Guatemala. Can you describe the circumstances that led you to fear for your safety?

APPLICANT: (Hesitates) It… it started a few years ago, when I started… being more open about being gay. In Guatemala, it is not easy. People… they don't understand.

OFFICER: Can you be more specific? What kind of reactions did you receive?

APPLICANT: At first, it was just whispers, you know? People looking at me funny. But then, it became more… aggressive. I would hear insults on the street – *maricón*, *pato*, things like that. Sometimes, people would throw things at me.

OFFICER: Can you recall any specific incidents? Dates, locations, individuals if possible?

APPLICANT: Yes. One time, maybe… two years ago, around June 2021, I was walking home from a friend’s house. It was late, maybe 10 PM. I was on Avenida La Reforma, near the Obelisco. A group of men, maybe four or five, they started following me. They were shouting insults, and then they started pushing me, hitting me. They… they left me on the ground. I had a broken nose and some bruises.

OFFICER: Did you report this incident to the police?

APPLICANT: No. I… I was afraid. The police in Guatemala, they are not always helpful, especially to people like me. I heard stories… of police officers being even worse than the gangs. I did not trust them.

OFFICER: Did you seek medical attention after this assault?

APPLICANT: Yes, I went to a small clinic. They cleaned my wounds and gave me some painkillers. I didn’t want to go to a big hospital, because I didn’t want anyone to ask too many questions.

OFFICER: You mentioned that this was not an isolated incident. Can you describe other instances of harassment or violence?

APPLICANT: Yes. There was another time, in March 2022, when I was at a gay bar in Zone 4. A group of men came in and started causing trouble. They were shouting homophobic slurs and throwing bottles. The bar owner tried to stop them, but they attacked him too. I was scared, so I tried to hide in the bathroom. But they found me, and they… they beat me again. Not as badly as the first time, but still… it was terrifying.

OFFICER: Did these men identify themselves? Did you recognize them?

APPLICANT: No, I didn't recognize them. They didn't say who they were, but they seemed like… gang members, maybe. They had tattoos and they were acting very aggressive.

OFFICER: Did you ever experience discrimination in the workplace, given your profession in construction?

APPLICANT: Yes, constantly. When I started working with my father, I tried to keep my sexual orientation a secret. But it's hard to hide. People would make jokes, tell stories about *maricones*. They would exclude me from conversations, from social events. My father, he tried to protect me, but he couldn't always be there. And sometimes, even he… he didn't understand. He would say things like, "Why can't you just be normal?"

OFFICER: Did your family know you were gay? How did they react?

APPLICANT: My mother, she suspected. She was always more understanding. But my father… he had a harder time accepting it. He loves me, I know, but he worries about me. He worries about what people will think. My brothers, they were… mixed. Sometimes they were supportive, sometimes they would tease me. My sisters, they were more accepting.

OFFICER: You mentioned your father tried to protect you. Did you ever seek help from other authorities or organizations in Guatemala?

APPLICANT: I considered it, but I was afraid. I heard stories about people going to the police and being turned away, or even being arrested themselves. And there are some LGBTQ+ organizations, but they don't have a lot of power. They can't really protect you from violence.

OFFICER: Did you consider moving to a different part of Guatemala to escape the harassment?

APPLICANT: I did think about it. Maybe moving to Quetzaltenango, or Antigua. But I didn't have the money. And even if I did move, I was afraid that the same thing would happen again. Homophobia is everywhere in Guatemala. It’s not just in Guatemala City.

OFFICER: So, you felt you had no other option but to leave the country?

APPLICANT: Yes. I felt like my life was in danger. I couldn't live like that anymore, always being afraid, always looking over my shoulder.

OFFICER: Can you describe your journey to the United States? When did you leave Guatemala, and what route did you take?

APPLICANT: I left Guatemala in April 2023. I took a bus to Mexico, and then I traveled north. It was a long and difficult journey. I crossed the border near Tijuana. I… I paid a coyote to help me.

OFFICER: And how long did the journey take?

APPLICANT: It took about two weeks.

OFFICER: You entered the United States without authorization. Why did you not seek legal entry?

APPLICANT: I knew that if I tried to get a visa, they would deny me. I had no other way to escape the persecution. I knew that asylum was an option, but I had to get here first.

OFFICER: What would happen to you if you were forced to return to Guatemala?

APPLICANT: (Starts to cry) I… I don't know. I'm afraid they would kill me. Or… or worse. I can't go back. I just can't. The gangs… they know who I am. They know where I live. They would find me.

OFFICER: Do you have any family members who are also at risk because of your sexual orientation?

APPLICANT: My sisters, maybe. They are supportive of me, and I worry that they could be targeted for being associated with me. But I don't know for sure. My parents… they are not gay, but they could be targeted because they are my parents.

OFFICER: Have you submitted any evidence to support your asylum claim?

APPLICANT: Yes, I submitted some photos of my injuries, and a copy of my university diploma. I also included a letter from a friend who witnessed some of the harassment. I wish I had more, but… it's hard to get evidence of these things.

OFFICER: I see that you have included a copy of a police report from 2018 regarding a robbery. Can you explain the relevance of this report to your asylum claim?

APPLICANT: (Confused) The… the robbery? I… I don’t remember submitting that. I was robbed once, a long time ago, but I didn’t think it was relevant. It was just a random crime.

OFFICER: It’s in your file. It seems to indicate you reported a theft of your phone and wallet. Is that correct?

APPLICANT: (Thinking hard) Yes, that’s right. But it wasn’t because I was gay. It was just… bad luck.

OFFICER: Okay. Thank you for clarifying. Let’s move on. If you are granted asylum in the United States, what are your plans for the future?

APPLICANT: I want to work. I want to contribute to society. I can use my skills in construction, maybe even find work as an architect. I want to learn English better, and maybe go back to school. I want to build a new life here, where I can be safe and free.

OFFICER: Given your background in architecture, do you have any specific career goals in the United States? Are you familiar with the licensing requirements for architects here?

APPLICANT: I am familiar with the licensing requirements, at least in a general sense. I know I would need to pass some exams and get some experience working under a licensed architect. I would be willing to do whatever it takes to get my license and work as an architect again. Even if I can't do that right away, I'm happy to work in construction. I'm a hard worker, and I'm willing to learn.

OFFICER: Do you have any family or friends in the United States who can provide you with support?

APPLICANT: I have one cousin in Los Angeles. I haven't seen him in many years, but he knows I'm here. He said he would help me if I need it.

OFFICER: Officer notes indicate that the applicant scored as intermediate in English proficiency upon intake. This is impressive given the applicant's relatively short time in the United States. Can you speak about your efforts to learn the language?

APPLICANT: Yes, I try to learn every day. I watch TV shows in English, and I use a language learning app. I also try to talk to people in English whenever I can. I know I need to improve my English if I want to be successful here.

OFFICER: Mr. Ramirez, I have a few more questions for you. You stated that you were beaten on multiple occasions. Did you ever fight back or defend yourself?

APPLICANT: (Hesitates) No… I was too scared. They were always bigger than me, and there were always more of them. I just tried to protect myself as best I could.

OFFICER: You mentioned that you paid a coyote to help you cross the border. How did you afford to pay the coyote?

APPLICANT: I saved up money from working in construction. And my family helped me. They sold some things to give me the money I needed. They knew how important it was for me to escape.

OFFICER: Mr. Ramirez, thank you for your testimony. I have no further questions at this time. Do you have anything else you would like to add?

APPLICANT: Yes. I just want to say that I am telling the truth. I am afraid to go back to Guatemala. I just want a chance to live a normal life here, without fear. Thank you for listening to me.

OFFICER: Thank you, Mr. Ramirez. This interview is now concluded. We will notify you of our decision in writing.
