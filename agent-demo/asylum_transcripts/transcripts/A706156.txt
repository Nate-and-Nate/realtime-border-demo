INTERVIEW BEGINS

OFFICER: Good morning, Mr. Khalil. My name is Officer Miller, and this is an interview to determine if you are eligible for asylum in the United States. I want to remind you that you are under oath, and everything you say must be truthful. Do you understand?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes, I understand.

OFFICER: Please raise your right hand and repeat after me: “I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God.”

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God.

OFFICER: Thank you. Please be seated. Before we begin, I want to clarify that I am not on your side, nor am I against you. My job is to gather the facts and make a recommendation to my supervisor. It will then be up to them to decide your case. Do you understand?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes, I understand.

OFFICER: You have indicated on your application that you fear persecution in Syria based on your race. Is that correct?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes, that is correct.

OFFICER: Okay. Let's start with some background information. What is your full name and date of birth?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) My name is Omar Khalil. My date of birth is March 10, 1982.

OFFICER: And where were you born?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) In Damascus, Syria.

OFFICER: What is your ethnicity?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I am Circassian.

OFFICER: Please explain to me why you fear persecution specifically because you are Circassian in Syria.

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) The Circassians are a small minority in Syria. We have always faced discrimination, but since the war started, it has become much worse. The government, and even some rebel groups, see us as outsiders, not truly Syrian. They accuse us of being loyal to Russia because many Circassians have strong cultural ties to the North Caucasus.

OFFICER: Can you give me specific examples of discrimination or mistreatment you experienced or witnessed?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes. Before the war, it was mostly subtle things. Difficulty getting jobs, being passed over for promotions, being treated differently by the police. But after 2011, it escalated. In 2013, my cousin, Samir, was arrested by government forces. He was accused of being a spy for the opposition because he spoke Russian. He was held for three months and tortured. When he was released, he was… changed. He wouldn't talk about what happened. He eventually fled to Turkey.

OFFICER: Do you know what specifically made them suspect him of spying?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Just that he spoke Russian and had family in Russia. It was enough for them. They were looking for any excuse to target Circassians.

OFFICER: You mentioned the war made things worse. Can you elaborate?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) (Hesitates) (Through interpreter) With the chaos of the war, extremist groups gained power. They saw Circassians as… infidels, because we are mostly Sunni Muslim, but we also have unique cultural traditions they don't understand or approve of. They threatened us, demanded we conform to their strict interpretation of Islam, and accused us of being spies for the West.

OFFICER: Did any of these groups directly threaten you?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes. In 2015, a group of men came to my house. They were armed and wore black masks. They said they knew I was a… a man of culture, that I was involved in preserving Circassian traditions. They said this was against Islam and that I needed to stop. They warned me that if I didn't, they would come back.

OFFICER: Did you report this incident to the police?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) No. The police were… unreliable. Many were corrupt, and some were even sympathetic to these extremist groups. Reporting it would have put me in even more danger.

OFFICER: You mentioned you are a “man of culture.” What do you mean by that? What is your profession?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I have a doctoral degree in Cultural Anthropology from Damascus University. I specialized in the study of Circassian folklore and traditions. I worked as a researcher at the National Museum in Damascus.

OFFICER: You have a doctoral degree. That's impressive. Can you tell me more about your research? What kind of traditions were you studying?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I studied the oral traditions, the songs, the dances, the stories that have been passed down through generations of Circassians. I believed it was important to preserve these traditions, to keep our culture alive.

OFFICER: Did your work at the museum put you at odds with the government or these extremist groups in any way?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) The government, before the war, was mostly indifferent. They didn't actively support my work, but they didn't actively stop it either. But the extremist groups… they saw it as a threat. They believed that preserving these traditions was a way of resisting their control, of maintaining a separate identity.

OFFICER: You said that in 2015, a group of men threatened you at your home. What did you do after that?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I was terrified. I knew I had to leave Damascus. I moved to Aleppo, thinking it would be safer. I stayed with relatives there.

OFFICER: Why did you think Aleppo would be safer?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) At that time, Aleppo was under the control of different rebel groups, not the government. I thought they would be more tolerant, less likely to target Circassians.

OFFICER: But you eventually left Aleppo, correct? Why?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) (Through interpreter) Aleppo became even more dangerous. The fighting between the government and the rebels intensified. The city was bombed constantly. There was no food, no water, no electricity. And the extremist groups were still present, still a threat. In 2017, my uncle, who I was staying with, was killed in a bombing. That's when I knew I had to leave Syria.

OFFICER: I'm sorry to hear about your uncle. Did you consider relocating to another part of Syria instead of leaving the country?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) There was nowhere safe left. Every part of Syria was controlled by either the government, the rebels, or the extremist groups. As a Circassian, I was vulnerable everywhere.

OFFICER: Can you describe your journey to the United States?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I traveled to Lebanon first. I stayed there for a few months, trying to find a way to get a visa. It was very difficult. Eventually, I was able to get a tourist visa to the United States. I flew to New York in 2018.

OFFICER: Did you have any trouble obtaining the visa?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) (Hesitates) (Through interpreter) It was… expensive. I had to pay a lot of money to a… a facilitator. They helped me with the application process.

OFFICER: A facilitator? You mean someone who helped you get the visa through unofficial channels?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) (Looks down) (Through interpreter) They helped me… prepare the application.

OFFICER: Did you provide false information on your visa application?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) (Through interpreter) No. The information was… mostly accurate.

OFFICER: "Mostly accurate"? Please explain.

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) (Sighs) (Through interpreter) I said I was coming to the United States for tourism. I didn't say I was planning to seek asylum.

OFFICER: I see. Thank you for being honest. Now, you mentioned you have family ties to citizens. Can you tell me about that?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes. My cousin, Samir's brother, lives in Los Angeles. He is a US citizen. He has been helping me since I arrived.

OFFICER: How has he been helping you?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) He has provided me with housing and financial support. He has also helped me find a lawyer to file my asylum application.

OFFICER: I see you are not represented by counsel today. Why is that?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I… I could not afford to continue paying the lawyer.

OFFICER: Okay. What do you plan to do if you are granted asylum in the United States?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I want to continue my work. I want to teach about Circassian culture, to preserve our traditions for future generations. I believe I can make a valuable contribution to American society. I could teach at a university, work in a museum, or even start my own cultural center.

OFFICER: Do you have any contacts in the United States who could help you with that?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) My cousin has introduced me to some people in the academic community. They are interested in my work.

OFFICER: Do you have any documents to support your claims of persecution or your background as a cultural anthropologist?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes. I have submitted copies of my doctoral degree, my museum employment records, and news articles about the situation of Circassians in Syria. I also have letters from my cousin and other members of the Circassian community in the United States who can vouch for my character and my work.

OFFICER: I've reviewed the documents you submitted. They appear to be in order. However, some of the news articles are difficult to verify independently. Do you have any other evidence that specifically corroborates the threats you received or the incident involving your cousin?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) (Through interpreter) No. I do not. It was very difficult to gather evidence in Syria. People were afraid to speak out.

OFFICER: I understand. Now, let's talk about why you cannot return to Syria. What would happen to you if you were forced to return?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) (Through interpreter) If I return to Syria, I will be in grave danger. The government will see me as a dissident, someone who fled the country and sought refuge in the United States. They will likely arrest me and torture me. The extremist groups will see me as an apostate, someone who has abandoned Islam. They will likely kill me.

OFFICER: Do you have any family members still in Syria?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) No. All of my immediate family members have either died or fled the country.

OFFICER: Do you have any questions for me at this time?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) (Through interpreter) Yes. I just want to know… do you think I have a chance?

OFFICER: (Through interpreter) Mr. Khalil, I cannot give you any guarantees. As I said before, my job is to gather the facts and make a recommendation. The final decision is up to my supervisor. However, I can assure you that I have listened to your story carefully and that I will present it fairly and accurately.

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) (Through interpreter) Thank you.

OFFICER: Thank you, Mr. Khalil. That concludes our interview. We will notify you of our decision in writing.
