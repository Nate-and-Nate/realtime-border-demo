INTERVIEW BEGINS

OFFICER: Good morning, Ms. Rodriguez. My name is Officer Miller, and my identification number is AO-4888. I am an asylum officer with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. This interview is to determine your eligibility for asylum in the United States. With me today is your attorney, correct?

APPLICANT: Yes, that's correct. This is Ms. Alvarez.

OFFICER: Good morning, Ms. Alvarez. Before we begin, I need to inform you of the purpose of this interview. We will discuss the information you provided in your Form I-589, Application for Asylum and Withholding of Removal. I will ask you questions to clarify the information you provided and to assess your credibility. Please answer all questions truthfully. This interview is being recorded. Do you understand?

APPLICANT: Yes, I understand.

OFFICER: I will now administer the oath. Please raise your right hand and repeat after me: "Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?"

APPLICANT: I do.

OFFICER: Thank you. Please be seated. Ms. Rodriguez, can you please state your full name and date of birth for the record?

APPLICANT: My full name is Valeria Sofia Rodriguez Perez, and my date of birth is October 12, 1999.

OFFICER: Thank you. Ms. Rodriguez, your application states that you are a citizen of Venezuela and that you are seeking asylum based on persecution related to your LGBTQ+ identity, specifically as a non-binary person. Is that correct?

APPLICANT: Yes, that is correct.

OFFICER: Let's start with your background. Can you tell me about your life in Venezuela? Where did you grow up, and what was your family like?

APPLICANT: I grew up in Caracas. I lived with my parents and my younger brother. My parents are… were… relatively traditional. My father worked in construction, and my mother was a teacher. They always emphasized the importance of education. Life was, you know, normal, until… until things started changing for me, internally.

OFFICER: And what do you mean by "changing internally?"

APPLICANT: Well, as I got older, I realized that I didn't identify with the gender I was assigned at birth. I started questioning things, experimenting with my appearance, and trying to understand who I truly was.

OFFICER: Can you elaborate on the timeline of this realization? When did you first start questioning your gender identity?

APPLICANT: I think it was around the age of 14 or 15. I started feeling… uncomfortable in traditionally feminine clothes. I felt more comfortable in clothes that were considered masculine. I also started using a different name with my close friends, a name that felt more… me. I didn't come out to my parents at that time, though. I was afraid of their reaction.

OFFICER: Your application indicates you have a Master's degree. Can you tell me about your education?

APPLICANT: Yes. I attended Universidad Central de Venezuela in Caracas. I obtained a Bachelor's degree in Economics and then continued for a Master's degree in Finance. It was… challenging, especially with the economic situation in Venezuela.

OFFICER: How did the economic situation affect your studies?

APPLICANT: It was difficult to afford basic necessities, including textbooks and transportation to the university. There were frequent power outages, which made studying at home difficult. Many of my professors left the country due to the economic crisis, which affected the quality of education.

OFFICER: And after your Master's, what did you do professionally?

APPLICANT: I worked as a financial analyst at a small investment firm in Caracas. I enjoyed my work; I was good at it. But… the political and social climate was becoming increasingly unbearable.

OFFICER: Can you describe the specific reasons you left Venezuela, focusing on the persecution you feared due to your LGBTQ+ identity?

APPLICANT: It wasn't one single event, but a series of incidents that made me realize I was not safe. The discrimination I faced became increasingly overt and threatening. It started with microaggressions and subtle insults, but it escalated over time.

OFFICER: Can you provide specific examples of these incidents?

APPLICANT: Yes. At work, my colleagues would make jokes about my appearance and my mannerisms. They would use derogatory terms and misgender me constantly, even after I politely corrected them. My boss, while not directly participating, did nothing to stop it. It created a hostile work environment.

OFFICER: Can you provide dates or a timeframe for when these incidents began?

APPLICANT: It started subtly around 2020, but it escalated significantly in 2022 and 2023. I remember one specific incident in July of 2022. I was at a company event, and a colleague, after drinking too much, cornered me and started making sexually suggestive comments. He also mocked my gender identity and threatened to "teach me a lesson." I reported the incident to HR, but they dismissed it as "just a joke."

OFFICER: Ms. Alvarez, do you have anything to add to this?

ATTORNEY: No, Officer, not at this time.

OFFICER: You mentioned these incidents escalated. Can you give me another example?

APPLICANT: Yes. Outside of work, I experienced harassment and discrimination in public. I remember walking down the street one day, wearing a shirt that I felt comfortable in, and a group of men started shouting homophobic slurs at me. They followed me for several blocks, and I was genuinely afraid for my safety. I had to duck into a store to get away from them.

OFFICER: Did you report these incidents to the police?

APPLICANT: No, I didn't. I didn't trust the police. They are known to be corrupt and often discriminate against LGBTQ+ individuals. I knew that reporting the incidents would likely be futile and could even put me at greater risk.

OFFICER: Did you ever consider relocating to a different part of Venezuela to escape this persecution?

APPLICANT: Yes, I did. I considered moving to a larger city like Valencia or Maracaibo, hoping that there would be more tolerance and acceptance. However, I realized that the discrimination against LGBTQ+ people is widespread throughout the country. Even if I moved, I would still be at risk. Also, finding a job in another city would be difficult, especially given the economic situation.

OFFICER: Your application mentions you had legal status in Venezuela before leaving. Can you elaborate on that?

APPLICANT: Yes, I had a valid passport and cédula (national identification card). I had no legal issues in Venezuela prior to leaving. I always complied with the law.

OFFICER: Why do you believe you cannot return to Venezuela?

APPLICANT: Because the situation has only gotten worse. The political and economic instability has fueled intolerance and discrimination. The LGBTQ+ community is increasingly vulnerable to violence and persecution. I fear for my life if I return. I know people who have been attacked, even killed, simply for being who they are. I can't live in constant fear like that.

OFFICER: Do you have any evidence to support your claims of persecution, such as police reports, medical records, or witness statements?

APPLICANT: I have submitted some evidence with my application, including news articles documenting the discrimination and violence against LGBTQ+ individuals in Venezuela. I also have photos of some of the graffiti and anti-LGBTQ+ propaganda that is prevalent in Caracas. Unfortunately, I don't have police reports because, as I mentioned, I didn't trust the police. I also don't have medical records because I didn't seek medical attention for the harassment I experienced. I was too afraid to go to a doctor.

OFFICER: What about any communication with friends or family that might corroborate your story?

APPLICANT: I have some messages with a close friend, Maria, where I discussed the harassment at work and the fear I felt. I can try to retrieve those and submit them. I was hesitant to talk about these things with my family. They wouldn't understand, and I didn't want to cause them worry.

OFFICER: Ms. Alvarez, would you like to add that to the record? The applicant will submit these messages with Maria?

ATTORNEY: Yes, Officer, we will supplement the application with those messages. Thank you.

OFFICER: What is your family situation in Venezuela? Are your parents and brother aware of your sexual orientation? Are they at risk?

APPLICANT: No, my parents are not aware. I never came out to them. I was too afraid of their reaction. My brother… I suspect he knows, or at least suspects something. He's always been more accepting than my parents. I worry about them, but I don't believe they are at immediate risk. They are not LGBTQ+, and they are not politically active. However, the general situation in Venezuela is dangerous for everyone.

OFFICER: Let’s talk about your travel to the United States. Can you describe your route, the timeline, and how you entered the country?

APPLICANT: I flew from Caracas to Bogota, Colombia. From Bogota, I flew to Mexico City. I stayed in Mexico City for a few days before flying to Los Angeles on a tourist visa. I entered the United States legally on February 15, 2024.

OFFICER: Why did you choose to come to the United States?

APPLICANT: I chose the United States because I knew that it offered legal protections for LGBTQ+ individuals. I had heard stories of other Venezuelans who had been granted asylum in the United States based on their sexual orientation. I felt that it was my only hope for a safe and secure future.

OFFICER: Your application states you entered on a tourist visa. What was your intention when you initially applied for the visa?

APPLICANT: Honestly, I was already considering seeking asylum when I applied for the visa. The situation in Venezuela was deteriorating rapidly, and I knew that I needed to find a way out. However, I didn't want to raise any red flags, so I applied for a tourist visa with the intention of overstaying and seeking asylum once I arrived in the United States.

OFFICER: Do you understand that misrepresenting your intentions when applying for a visa can have serious consequences?

APPLICANT: Yes, I understand. I was desperate, and I felt that it was the only way to escape the persecution I was facing. I regret not being completely honest, but I truly believed that my life was in danger.

OFFICER: What are your plans if you are granted asylum in the United States?

APPLICANT: I want to rebuild my life and contribute to society. I want to use my education and professional skills to find a job in the finance industry. I am fluent in English and Spanish, and I am confident that I can quickly adapt to the American work environment. I also want to get involved in LGBTQ+ advocacy and help others who are fleeing persecution. I want to make a positive impact on the world.

OFFICER: Have you ever been arrested or convicted of a crime, either in Venezuela or in the United States?

APPLICANT: No, never. I have never been arrested or convicted of any crime.

OFFICER: Are you now, or have you ever been, a member of any political party or organization in Venezuela?

APPLICANT: No, I have never been a member of any political party or organization. I have always tried to stay out of politics.

OFFICER: Ms. Rodriguez, you stated you worked as a financial analyst. Can you elaborate on the types of tasks you performed and the skills you developed? This is relevant to assessing your potential for integration into the U.S. economy.

APPLICANT: Certainly. As a financial analyst, I was responsible for analyzing financial data, preparing financial reports, and making investment recommendations. I developed strong analytical and problem-solving skills, as well as proficiency in financial modeling and forecasting. I also gained experience in risk management and portfolio management. I am proficient in using financial software such as Bloomberg Terminal and Excel. I believe these skills are highly transferable and would be valuable in the U.S. finance industry.

OFFICER: Have you taken any steps to explore job opportunities in the United States?

APPLICANT: Yes, I have. I have been networking with people in the finance industry and researching job openings online. I have also started working on my resume and cover letter to tailor them to the U.S. job market. I am eager to start working as soon as possible.

OFFICER: Do you have any questions for me at this time?

APPLICANT: No, I think you have covered everything. Thank you for your time and consideration.

ATTORNEY: Officer, I just want to reiterate that Ms. Rodriguez has a well-founded fear of persecution if she were to return to Venezuela. The evidence she has presented, combined with her credible testimony, clearly establishes her eligibility for asylum.

OFFICER: Thank you, Ms. Alvarez.

OFFICER: Ms. Rodriguez, thank you for your testimony today. I will review your application and the evidence you have provided, and you will receive a written decision in the mail.
