INTERVIEW BEGINS

OFFICER: Good morning, Mr. Rodriguez. My name is Officer Miller, and this is Asylum Officer Diaz. We are here today to conduct an interview regarding your application for asylum in the United States. I need to inform you of the purpose of this interview and the process involved. This interview is to determine whether you meet the requirements for asylum under U.S. law. You have the right to be represented by an attorney, but I understand you are proceeding without one today. Is that correct?

APPLICANT: Yes, Officer. That is correct. I… I could not afford one.

OFFICER: Okay. Do you understand that you are required to answer all questions truthfully and completely? Your statements will be made under oath, and any false statements could have serious consequences, including denial of your application and potential criminal penalties. Do you understand?

APPLICANT: Yes, I understand.

OFFICER: Please raise your right hand and repeat after me: "I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God."

APPLICANT: I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God.

OFFICER: Thank you. Please be seated. For the record, can you please state your full name and date of birth?

APPLICANT: My name is Marco Antonio Rodriguez, and my date of birth is July 12, 1970.

OFFICER: Thank you. Now, Mr. Rodriguez, your application states that you are seeking asylum based on fear of persecution due to your religious beliefs in Honduras. Can you tell me more about your religious beliefs and why you fear persecution?

APPLICANT: Yes, Officer. I… I am a Christian. I believe in Jesus Christ. In Honduras, there are… very powerful gangs. They don't like Christians. They see us as… weak. They want everyone to follow their rules, their… dark practices.

OFFICER: What specific religious practices do you adhere to? Do you belong to a particular denomination?

APPLICANT: I… I go to a small church in my village. It’s… a non-denominational Christian church. We read the Bible, we pray, we sing hymns. Simple things.

OFFICER: How often did you attend this church?

APPLICANT: Every Sunday. And… sometimes on Wednesdays for Bible study.

OFFICER: Can you name the church and the pastor?

APPLICANT: The church is called… Iglesia de la Esperanza. Church of Hope. The pastor… his name is Pastor Ricardo. I don't remember his last name.

OFFICER: You don’t remember the last name of the pastor of your church where you attended regularly?

APPLICANT: No, Officer. I am very bad with names.

OFFICER: Okay. You mentioned gangs. Can you elaborate on how these gangs threatened you specifically due to your religious beliefs?

APPLICANT: They… they would come to our church. They would yell at us during services. They called us names… "fanatics," "weaklings." They said we were wasting our time praying when we should be… helping them. They demanded money, "taxes," they called it.

OFFICER: When did this begin?

APPLICANT: About… two years before I left.

OFFICER: Can you recall the first specific incident where you felt threatened? Please provide as much detail as possible, including the date, location, and individuals involved.

APPLICANT: Yes. It was… maybe May of 2022. I was walking home from church, and two men stopped me. They were… very big, with tattoos. They asked me if I was a Christian. I said yes. They pushed me against a wall and told me that if I kept going to church, I would regret it. They said… they would make an example of me. I didn't recognize them. They were just… gang members.

OFFICER: Did you report this incident to the police?

APPLICANT: No. The police… they are corrupt. They are afraid of the gangs. They would not help me. They might even tell the gangs I reported them.

OFFICER: Did they physically harm you during this incident?

APPLICANT: No, just… pushed me. Threatened me.

OFFICER: You mentioned they demanded money. How often did they do this, and how much did they ask for?

APPLICANT: They came to my house… maybe once a month. They would ask for… 500 Lempiras. Sometimes more. It was a lot of money for me.

OFFICER: What is your profession, Mr. Rodriguez?

APPLICANT: I am… I was a… a technician. I fixed… machines. At a factory.

OFFICER: What kind of machines did you fix? Can you describe your work in more detail?

APPLICANT: All kinds of machines. The factory made… plastic bottles. I would fix the… the molding machines, the conveyor belts, the… everything. I learned on the job.

OFFICER: You indicated on your application that you completed primary school. How did you acquire the skills necessary to repair complex machinery with that level of education?

APPLICANT: I… I am a fast learner. I watched the older technicians. I asked questions. I read manuals. I am good with my hands.

OFFICER: Can you provide any evidence of your employment at this factory? Pay stubs, a letter from your employer, anything like that?

APPLICANT: No. I… I didn't bring anything like that. I was afraid… I had to leave quickly.

OFFICER: Did these gang members ever target other members of your church?

APPLICANT: Yes. They… they vandalized the church. They broke windows. They spray-painted… bad words on the walls.

OFFICER: Did you witness this vandalism yourself?

APPLICANT: Yes. I saw it… the next morning. Everyone was very scared.

OFFICER: Did anyone get physically hurt during these incidents?

APPLICANT: No… not that I know of. Just… scared.

OFFICER: Did you try to relocate to another part of Honduras to avoid these gangs?

APPLICANT: No. I didn't have the money. And… I was afraid they would find me. They have… connections everywhere.

OFFICER: Why do you believe you cannot return to Honduras now?

APPLICANT: Because… they will kill me. They know I left. They will see me as… a traitor. Someone who ran away. They will punish me.

OFFICER: You stated on your application that you have a wife and a child. Are they also at risk?

APPLICANT: Yes. Very much. My wife… she is also a Christian. My son… he is only 12. They will try to recruit him into the gang. I had to leave them behind… to protect them. I am trying to get them here.

OFFICER: You left them behind to protect them, but you also said they are at risk. Can you explain this apparent contradiction?

APPLICANT: I… I mean, they are at risk because I am gone. The gangs will think I ran away to get help, to bring the police to them. They will be angry.

OFFICER: When did you leave Honduras, and what route did you take to get to the United States?

APPLICANT: I left in… August of this year. I took a bus to Guatemala, then to Mexico. Then… I crossed the border into Texas.

OFFICER: How did you enter the United States?

APPLICANT: I… I crossed the river.

OFFICER: Did you have any encounters with law enforcement during your journey?

APPLICANT: No.

OFFICER: How did you afford the journey?

APPLICANT: I… I sold everything I had. My tools, my furniture… everything.

OFFICER: What are your plans if you are granted asylum in the United States?

APPLICANT: I want to work. I want to use my skills to… to contribute to this country. I can fix machines. I can learn new things. I want to bring my wife and son here… to give them a safe life.

OFFICER: Have you ever been arrested or convicted of a crime in Honduras or any other country?

APPLICANT: No. Never.

OFFICER: Do you have any family members currently residing in the United States?

APPLICANT: No.

OFFICER: Mr. Rodriguez, I have a few more questions about your religious practices. You mentioned attending church every Sunday and sometimes on Wednesdays. Can you describe a typical Sunday service? What hymns do you sing? What are the sermons usually about?

APPLICANT: We… we sing hymns from the Bible. Old hymns. I don't remember the names. The sermons are about… God. About Jesus. About being good people.

OFFICER: Can you recall any specific Bible verses that are frequently cited in your church?

APPLICANT: I… I don't remember specific verses. I just… listen to the pastor.

OFFICER: Okay. I notice on your application that you indicated fluency in English. Where did you learn English?

APPLICANT: I learned… a little in school. And… I watched American movies.

OFFICER: You only completed primary school. What level of English instruction did you receive?

APPLICANT: Very basic. Just… some words.

OFFICER: So, you would say you are self-taught?

APPLICANT: Yes.

OFFICER: You seem to understand and respond to my questions very well. Your English seems better than someone who only had basic instruction in primary school and learned from movies.

APPLICANT: I… I try my best. I have been practicing.

OFFICER: One final question, Mr. Rodriguez. Can you explain the discrepancy between your claim of being a skilled technician capable of repairing complex machinery and your limited formal education? Many technical roles require significant theoretical knowledge and specialized training.

APPLICANT: I… I told you, I learned on the job. I am very good with my hands. I can figure things out. I may not have a fancy diploma, but I can fix anything. The factory needed someone to fix the machines and I stepped up.

OFFICER: Thank you, Mr. Rodriguez. That concludes our interview. We will notify you of our decision in writing. Do you have any questions for us?

APPLICANT: No, Officer. Thank you for your time.
