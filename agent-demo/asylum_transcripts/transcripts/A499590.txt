INTERVIEW BEGINS

OFFICER: Good morning. My name is Officer Miller, and my employee number is AO-5679. I'm an asylum officer with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. This interview is to determine whether you are eligible for asylum in the United States. I need to advise you that you are not required to answer any question that you believe would incriminate you. Do you understand?

APPLICANT: Yes, I understand.

OFFICER: I also need to advise you that any statements you make may be used in future immigration proceedings. Do you understand?

APPLICANT: Yes.

OFFICER: Finally, please raise your right hand and swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

APPLICANT: I do.

OFFICER: Thank you. Please state your full name and date of birth for the record.

APPLICANT: My name is Mateo Vargas, and my date of birth is October 15, 2003.

OFFICER: Thank you. Now, Mateo, you are in removal proceedings and are seeking asylum as a defense. Is that correct?

APPLICANT: Yes, that is correct.

OFFICER: Alright. Let's begin with some background information. Where were you born?

APPLICANT: I was born in Managua, Nicaragua.

OFFICER: And you are a citizen of Nicaragua?

APPLICANT: Yes.

OFFICER: You indicated on your application that you identify as non-binary. Can you explain what that means to you, and how this identity relates to your fear of persecution in Nicaragua?

APPLICANT: Um, well, it means that I don't identify as male or female. I don't feel like either of those labels fit me. In Nicaragua, especially in my neighborhood, being different like that…it's not accepted. People are very traditional. They… they make fun of you, they call you names, sometimes worse. They connect it with the political situation there. They think you're not a "real" Nicaraguan if you don't conform.

OFFICER: Can you provide specific examples of how you were treated differently or faced any harm because of your gender identity?

APPLICANT: Well, mostly it was verbal harassment. People would shout things at me in the street. Like, *pato*, which is a derogatory term. And sometimes… sometimes they would throw things. Rocks, mostly. One time, a group of guys followed me home, yelling. I was really scared.

OFFICER: Did you report these incidents to the police?

APPLICANT: No. I didn't think it would do any good. The police… they are not always helpful, especially if you are, you know, different.

OFFICER: Let's move on to your education. You stated you have a Bachelor's degree. Where did you obtain this degree, and in what field of study?

APPLICANT: I… I got it from the Universidad Centroamericana in Managua. It was in… uh… Civil Engineering.

OFFICER: Civil Engineering? And you also stated on your application that you have a background in trades and construction. Can you elaborate on how these two are related?

APPLICANT: Yes. After I graduated, it was hard to find a job, especially a good paying one. So I started working with my uncle. He has a small construction business. I helped him with everything – you know, like, mixing cement, laying bricks, things like that.

OFFICER: So, your uncle had you doing manual labor, even though you have a degree in civil engineering?

APPLICANT: Well, yes. I needed to earn money. And it was good experience too. It helped me understand the practical side of things.

OFFICER: Okay. Now, let’s talk about why you left Nicaragua. You are claiming asylum based on fear of persecution due to your nationality. Can you explain in detail why you fear returning?

APPLICANT: It's… it's because of the political situation. The government… they are very oppressive. They target anyone who speaks out against them, or who is perceived to be against them. And being non-binary… it’s seen as a form of rebellion. It's connected to the opposition.

OFFICER: But you stated the harassment you experienced was mostly from individuals, not directly from the government. Can you explain the link between your experiences and the government persecution you fear?

APPLICANT: Well, the government creates an environment where this kind of behavior is tolerated, even encouraged. They demonize anyone who is different. They say we are not real Nicaraguans. They use us as scapegoats.

OFFICER: Can you provide any specific examples of how the government targeted you or others like you?

APPLICANT: I… I didn't experience direct targeting, like arrest or detention. But I saw it happen to others. People who were involved in protests, or who were openly LGBTQ+. They were arrested, beaten… disappeared.

OFFICER: Can you give me the names of anyone you personally know who experienced this?

APPLICANT: Um… I don't want to say their names. I'm afraid of what might happen to them if I do.

OFFICER: I understand your concern. But without specific details, it's difficult for me to assess the credibility of your claim. Can you at least describe one specific incident you witnessed?

APPLICANT: Okay. I saw… I saw police officers beating a young man at a protest. It was in front of the university. He was holding a rainbow flag. They dragged him away, and I never saw him again. This was… I think it was in 2021, maybe July.

OFFICER: You graduated with a Civil Engineering degree, why were you at a protest?

APPLICANT: I went with friends and classmates. We feel the government is corrupt and does not give Nicaraguans a future.

OFFICER: Did you participate in the protest, or were you just observing?

APPLICANT: I was... I was just observing. I was too afraid to get involved directly.

OFFICER: Did you ever try to relocate to a different part of Nicaragua to avoid the harassment you were experiencing?

APPLICANT: No. I didn't have the money to move. And I didn't think it would make a difference. The government's influence is everywhere.

OFFICER: Did you ever seek protection from the authorities – report the harassment to the police, for example?

APPLICANT: No. As I said, I didn't trust them. I was afraid they would make things worse.

OFFICER: What evidence do you have to support your claim for asylum? Have you submitted any documents, photos, or other materials?

APPLICANT: I submitted a copy of my diploma, and some news articles about the political situation in Nicaragua. Also, a letter from my uncle saying that I worked for him.

OFFICER: I see. And what about evidence to support your claim of persecution based on your gender identity? Do you have any medical records, photos of injuries, or witness statements?

APPLICANT: No. I didn't take any photos of the harassment. And I didn't go to the doctor. I just wanted to forget about it.

OFFICER: You mentioned you have family members in Nicaragua. How many, and are they also at risk?

APPLICANT: Yes. My parents and three younger siblings are still there. I'm very worried about them.

OFFICER: Are they facing any specific threats?

APPLICANT: Well, they are my family. They might be targeted because of me. And the general political situation is very dangerous for everyone.

OFFICER: Let's talk about your travel to the United States. Can you describe your route, timeline, and mode of entry?

APPLICANT: I left Nicaragua in… in March of this year. I flew to Mexico City, then took a bus to the border. I crossed the border illegally.

OFFICER: Who helped you with your travel arrangements?

APPLICANT: I had a friend who helped me book the flight. And I met some people on the bus who gave me advice about crossing the border.

OFFICER: Did you pay anyone to help you cross the border?

APPLICANT: No. I just followed the instructions I got from the people on the bus.

OFFICER: What are your plans if you are granted asylum in the United States?

APPLICANT: I want to work. I want to use my skills to contribute to society. I can work in construction. I would like to maybe go back to school and get a masters degree.

OFFICER: Considering your degree in Civil Engineering, there is a critical skill shortage in the construction industry here in the United States. How do you plan to utilize your specific skills and education to address this shortage?

APPLICANT: I can… I can work as a junior engineer. I can help with planning and design. I can learn more about American building codes and standards. I'm a hard worker. I'm willing to learn.

OFFICER: You mentioned earlier that you worked for your uncle after graduating because you couldn’t find a job. Why do you think you will have more success finding a job as a civil engineer in the United States, when you couldn't find one in Nicaragua?

APPLICANT: Because there are more jobs here. And I am fluent in English.

OFFICER: And how did you become fluent in English?

APPLICANT: I learned it in school, and by watching movies and TV shows.

OFFICER: Are you aware that providing false information to a U.S. government official can have serious consequences for your immigration case?

APPLICANT: Yes, I understand.

OFFICER: Mateo, I have some concerns regarding some inconsistencies in your testimony. You stated you have a Bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering, but your work experience is primarily in manual labor. You also mentioned that you didn't experience direct targeting by the government, but rather fear persecution based on the general political climate and the experiences of others. Furthermore, you are hesitant to provide specific details about the incidents you witnessed, citing fear for the safety of others, which makes it difficult to verify your claims. Finally, the connection between your gender identity and the persecution you are alleging seems weak.

APPLICANT: I… I understand your concerns. I'm just trying to be honest. I'm really scared to go back.

OFFICER: Thank you for your testimony, Mateo. I don't have any further questions at this time. Do you have anything else you would like to add?

APPLICANT: No, I think that's all.

OFFICER: Okay. This interview is concluded. You will receive a written decision regarding your asylum application in the mail.
