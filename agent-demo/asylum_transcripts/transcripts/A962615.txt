INTERVIEW BEGINS

OFFICER: Good morning, Mr. Amiri. My name is Officer Davis, and this is Officer Miller. We are Asylum Officers with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. This is an interview regarding your application for asylum in the United States. With me today is the interpreter, who will translate everything that is said during this interview. Please raise your right hand and repeat after me: Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes, I swear.

OFFICER: Thank you. Please state your full name and date of birth for the record.

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) My name is Ahmad Amiri. My date of birth is 1993, June 10th.

OFFICER: Thank you. And Ms. Chen, you are representing Mr. Amiri today?

ATTORNEY: Yes, Officer Davis, that is correct.

OFFICER: Okay, Mr. Amiri, we have reviewed your application, Form I-589, Application for Asylum and Withholding of Removal. We will now ask you questions to clarify the information you provided and to gather additional information. Please answer honestly and to the best of your ability. Let’s start with your background. Where were you born and where did you grow up?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I was born in Kabul, and I grew up in Kabul. All my life.

OFFICER: And what is your ethnicity and religious affiliation?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I am a Pashtun, and I am a Sunni Muslim.

OFFICER: You are claiming persecution based on your nationality. Can you explain why you fear returning to Afghanistan as a Pashtun?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) After the Taliban took over, life became very difficult for Pashtuns. They… they accused us of working with the old government, even if we did not. They say we are traitors. They treat us badly.

OFFICER: Can you provide specific examples of how you were mistreated or witnessed the mistreatment of other Pashtuns?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes. I… I worked in a clinic. A small clinic in Kabul. One day, the Taliban came. They were looking for someone. They said he was a spy. They didn't find him, but they beat the other doctors. They said, “You are all Pashtuns, you are all the same.” I was very scared.

OFFICER: When did this incident at the clinic occur?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) It was… it was about six months after they took Kabul. Maybe… March of 2022.

OFFICER: You said you worked in a clinic. What was your role there?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I was… I was a helper. I cleaned the rooms, I helped the doctors… I helped the nurses. I studied… I studied a little bit of medicine in school, so I could help.

OFFICER: Your application states you completed secondary education. Did you receive any formal certification or diploma after completing your studies?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes, I have a… a certificate. I submitted it with my application, I think. It is… it is a high school diploma.

OFFICER: I see. Your application mentions you have some medical training. Can you elaborate on that? What specific training did you receive?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Like I said, I studied a little in school. I learned… I learned about first aid, about… about how to clean wounds. I learned from the doctors at the clinic. They showed me things.

OFFICER: Did you receive any formal certification for this medical training?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) No, no certificate. Just… just what I learned.

OFFICER: Okay. Let’s go back to the incident at the clinic. You said the Taliban were looking for someone specific. Did you know who they were looking for?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) No, I didn't know. They didn't say his name.

OFFICER: Did you report this incident to the police or any other authority?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) No! No, I couldn't. The Taliban *are* the police now. Who would I report to?

OFFICER: Did this incident cause you to leave Kabul?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Not right away. But… but it made me scared. I started to think about leaving. Then… then other things happened.

OFFICER: What other things happened?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) My cousin… he was taken. They said he was working with the Americans. He wasn't! He was just a teacher. But they took him. And then… then I heard he was killed.

OFFICER: When did this happen?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) This was… maybe two months after the clinic incident. May of 2022.

OFFICER: Do you have any proof of your cousin's death or his arrest?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) No. I just… I just heard it from his family. They were very scared to talk about it.

OFFICER: Did you experience any direct threats or violence yourself, besides the incident at the clinic?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) No… not directly. But I was afraid. Everyone was afraid.

OFFICER: Before leaving Afghanistan, did you try to relocate to a different part of the country?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) No. Where could I go? They are everywhere. The Taliban control everything.

OFFICER: Your application states you have a wife and two children. Are they with you in the United States?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) No. They are still in Afghanistan.

OFFICER: Are they also Pashtun?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes, of course.

OFFICER: Do you believe they are also at risk?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes! Very much so. That is why I am here. To try to bring them here.

OFFICER: When did you leave Afghanistan, and what route did you take to get to the United States?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I left in… in July of 2022. I went to Pakistan first. Then to Turkey. Then to Mexico. Then I crossed the border.

OFFICER: How long did it take you to travel from Afghanistan to the United States?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Many months. Maybe… five months. It was very difficult.

OFFICER: Can you provide more details about your journey through Mexico? How did you travel, and who did you travel with?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I… I paid someone to help me. A… a guide. He took me on buses. We walked sometimes. It was very dangerous. Many bad people there.

OFFICER: Do you have any documentation to support your travel, such as plane tickets or border crossing documents?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) No. The guide took everything. He said I didn't need it.

OFFICER: What are your plans if you are granted asylum in the United States?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I want to work. I want to bring my family here. I want to… to help people. Maybe I can work in a hospital again.

OFFICER: Given your limited formal medical training, what specific role do you believe you could fill in a hospital setting in the United States?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I can learn! I am a hard worker. I can clean rooms, I can help the nurses. I am willing to do anything.

OFFICER: Ms. Chen, do you have any questions for your client at this time?

ATTORNEY: Yes, Officer Davis. Mr. Amiri, can you describe in more detail the atmosphere of fear and oppression that Pashtuns experienced under the Taliban regime?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) It was… it was like living in a prison. You never knew who you could trust. The Taliban were everywhere. They watched everything. They listened to everything. You couldn't say anything bad about them. You couldn't even… you couldn't even listen to music. They would punish you.

ATTORNEY: Thank you. That's all for now.

OFFICER: Mr. Amiri, you stated that you heard about your cousin's death from his family. Did you ever see his body or attend his funeral?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) No. They… they wouldn't let us. The Taliban wouldn't let us have a funeral. They said he was a traitor.

OFFICER: Did you try to confirm this information with any other sources, such as other relatives or friends?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) No. Everyone was too scared to talk about it.

OFFICER: You mentioned an incident at the clinic in March 2022. Can you recall the names of any of the doctors or nurses who were present during that incident?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I… I don't remember their names. It was a long time ago. I was very scared.

OFFICER: Was this a private clinic, or was it run by the government?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) It was… it was a private clinic. A small one.

OFFICER: And what was the name of the clinic?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I… I don't remember. I am sorry.

OFFICER: Mr. Amiri, your application states that you fear persecution specifically because you are Pashtun. However, Pashtuns make up a significant portion of the population in Afghanistan, and many Pashtuns hold positions of power within the Taliban. Can you explain why you believe *you*, specifically, are at risk?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Because… because they think we are all traitors. They don't trust us. Even if we are Pashtun. If you are not with them completely, they don't trust you. And I… I was not with them.

OFFICER: You have not provided any documentation corroborating your claims of persecution or your cousin's death. Is there any reason why you were unable to obtain such evidence?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) It is very difficult to get documents in Afghanistan now. Everything is controlled by the Taliban. And people are afraid to talk.

OFFICER: Mr. Amiri, I am going to ask you a few more questions about your journey to the United States. You mentioned paying a guide to help you cross the border from Mexico. How much did you pay this guide?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I paid him… $5000.

OFFICER: Where did you get that money?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I… I sold everything I had. My house, my furniture… everything.

OFFICER: You stated you sold your house. Do you have any documentation showing that you owned a house in Kabul?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) No. It was… it was in my father's name. He is dead now.

OFFICER: Okay. And who did you sell the house to?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I… I don't know his name. Just a man. The guide helped me find him.

OFFICER: Mr. Amiri, you stated earlier that you studied medicine in school. Can you tell me the name of the school you attended and the years you attended it?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I… I didn't study *medicine* exactly. I just… I studied science in high school. I learned some things about the body.

OFFICER: So you did not attend a medical school or any institution offering formal medical training?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) No. Just… just high school.

OFFICER: I see. So, to clarify, your work at the clinic was primarily as a cleaner and helper, and your medical knowledge was based on informal learning and observation?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes. That is correct.

OFFICER: One final question, Mr. Amiri. What specific skills or knowledge do you possess that would allow you to successfully integrate into American society and contribute to the economy?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I am a hard worker. I am willing to learn. I can do any job. I am grateful for the opportunity to be here.

OFFICER: Thank you, Mr. Amiri. That concludes our interview. We will review your application and the information you provided today, and you will receive a decision in writing. Ms. Chen, do you have any final comments?

ATTORNEY: No, Officer Davis, thank you for your time.

OFFICER: Thank you both.
