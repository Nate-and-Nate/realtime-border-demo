I need to explain the process and my role to you. This interview is conducted under oath. That means that everything you say must be truthful. Do you understand?

OFFICER: Mr. Rodriguez, can you confirm your current address for the record?

OFFICER: Thank you. Now, let’s begin with your background. Where in Venezuela were you born and raised?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I have one sister. She still lives in Caracas with her husband and children.

OFFICER: And your parents?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) My parents… they passed away. My mother, five years ago, from cancer. My father, two years ago, from a heart attack.

OFFICER: I'm sorry to hear that. Let’s talk about your education. You indicated on your application that you completed secondary education. Can you tell me about the school you attended?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes. I went to… *pauses, searching for the word*… high school, Liceo Andres Bello, in Caracas.

OFFICER: And what subjects did you study?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Basic subjects. Math, science, history, Spanish… the normal things. I wasn’t a… how you say… a brilliant student, but I finished.

OFFICER: After high school, did you pursue any further education or training?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) No. I… I went to the military service, obligatory. After that, I got a job.

OFFICER: You mentioned working in the government/military on your application. Can you elaborate on your role and responsibilities?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes. After my mandatory military service, I was offered a position in the… *pauses*… the Ministry of Defense. I worked in logistics. I was responsible for… *struggles to find the word*… supplying the military with… food, uniforms, equipment.

OFFICER: How long did you work in the Ministry of Defense?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) About fifteen years. From 1998 to 2013.

OFFICER: Why did you leave that position?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Because… because the corruption became too much. I saw things… things I couldn't accept. People stealing money, diverting resources… and if you spoke out, you were… *gestures with his hand, a cutting motion across his throat*. It became dangerous.

OFFICER: Can you give me a specific example of the corruption you witnessed?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes. There was… a contract for boots. Military boots. A large contract. I saw the documents. The price was inflated. Way too high. And the boots… they were of very poor quality. I knew that the difference in price… the extra money… was going into someone’s pocket. A general, probably.

OFFICER: Did you report this to anyone?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) No. I was afraid. I knew what could happen. People disappear.

OFFICER: You stated you left in 2013. What did you do after leaving the Ministry of Defense?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I tried to find other work. It was difficult. I had worked for the government for so long… people were suspicious. I eventually got a job as a security guard in a private company.

OFFICER: Now, let's move on to the reasons you left Venezuela and are seeking asylum. You indicated a fear of persecution based on membership in a particular social group. Can you explain what that social group is and why you fear persecution?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes. It is… it is people who speak out against the government. People who… who want change. Who believe in democracy. People who… who criticize the corruption and the… the oppression.

OFFICER: And how are you a member of this group?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Because… because I spoke out. Not publicly, but… to my friends, to my family. I expressed my… my discontent with the situation. And… and I helped… secretly… with some… with some groups that were organizing protests.

OFFICER: What kind of help did you provide to these groups?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I… I used my connections from the Ministry of Defense to… to get them information. Information about… about police movements, about potential… crackdowns. I also helped them to… to get supplies.

OFFICER: Can you provide specific dates or timeframes when you assisted these groups?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) It was… mostly in 2017. During the big protests. I remember one specific time… it was in… July, I think. July 15th, 2017. I learned that the police were planning to… to raid a meeting place of one of the groups. I warned them, and they were able to… to move to a different location.

OFFICER: How did you learn about the planned raid?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Through a friend. A former colleague from the Ministry of Defense. He still had contacts there.

OFFICER: You said you spoke out against the government to friends and family. Did this cause any problems for you?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes. In 2018… I was… *pauses, visibly agitated*… I was arrested.

OFFICER: Can you tell me about that?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) (Through interpreter) It was… early in the morning. The SEBIN… the intelligence police… they came to my house. They… they broke down the door. They searched the house. They… they found some… some leaflets… from one of the protest groups. They arrested me and took me to… La Tumba.

OFFICER: La Tumba?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) (Through interpreter) Yes. It is a… a prison. A terrible place. Underground. Small cells. No sunlight.

OFFICER: What happened to you in La Tumba?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) (Through interpreter) They… they interrogated me. They asked me about my… my connections to the protest groups. They… they wanted names. They… they beat me. Not… not severely, but… enough to… to intimidate me. To make me afraid.

OFFICER: How long were you detained?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) (Through interpreter) Three days.

OFFICER: And why were you released?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) (Through interpreter) I… I don’t know for sure. I think… I think maybe my sister… she used some… some connections. My brother-in-law knows someone… in the government. I think they… they paid someone off.

OFFICER: After your release, did you report the incident to the police or any other authorities?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) (Through interpreter) No. Absolutely not. That would have been… crazy. The police are… they are part of the problem. They are the ones who… who arrest people like me.

OFFICER: Did you experience any further incidents or threats after your release?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) (Through interpreter) Yes. I was… I was being watched. I could feel it. People… following me. Cars… parked outside my house. I knew… I knew they were watching me. And then… one night… someone broke into my apartment. They didn’t steal anything. They just… ransacked the place. They left a message… spray-painted on the wall: “We know who you are.”

OFFICER: Do you have any photographs of the damage to your apartment or the message that was left?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) (Through interpreter) No. I was too afraid to… to take pictures. I just… I just cleaned it up as quickly as possible. I didn’t want anyone to see.

OFFICER: Why did you not relocate to another part of Venezuela to avoid these problems?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) (Through interpreter) Because… the government… the reach of the government… it is everywhere. There is no safe place in Venezuela. They have… informants… everywhere. It doesn’t matter where you go. They will find you.

OFFICER: Why do you fear returning to Venezuela now?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) (Through interpreter) Because… because they know I left. They know I am here… seeking asylum. That makes me… a traitor. If I go back… they will arrest me. They will torture me. They might even… kill me. I am certain of it.

OFFICER: Do you have any family members who are currently experiencing problems in Venezuela because of your actions?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) (Through interpreter) I am very worried about my sister. I speak to her on the phone… carefully. I don’t tell her everything. But I know… she is being watched too. Because of me.

OFFICER: You mentioned having family ties to citizens in the United States. Can you tell me about that?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) (Through interpreter) Yes. I have… a cousin. Maria. She is a citizen. She lives in Miami. She helped me… to get here.

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) (Through interpreter) I have… some letters from my friends in Venezuela. They… they are afraid to write too much, but… they confirm that I was… that I was involved in the protests. And… I have a copy of my… my military service record.

OFFICER: Please provide those to Officer Davis. Mr. Rodriguez, I understand this has been a difficult interview. Do you have anything else you would like to add?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) (Through interpreter) I just… I just want to say that… I am telling the truth. I am afraid to go back to Venezuela. I am asking for your help.
