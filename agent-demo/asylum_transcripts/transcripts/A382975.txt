INTERVIEW BEGINS

OFFICER: Good morning. My name is Officer Reynolds, and my employee number is AO-6028. I am an asylum officer with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. This is an interview regarding your application for asylum in the United States, form I-589. I need to inform you of the purpose of this interview and advise you of your rights. The purpose of this interview is to determine whether you meet the requirements for asylum under U.S. law. I will ask you questions about your background, your experiences in your home country, and your reasons for seeking asylum here. It is very important that you answer all of my questions truthfully and completely. Do you understand?

APPLICANT: Yes, I understand.

OFFICER: You have the right to have an attorney or accredited representative present during this interview. I see that you are accompanied by an attorney today. Is that correct?

APPLICANT: Yes, that is correct. This is my attorney, Ms. Evans.

OFFICER: Good morning, Ms. Evans. Please state your name and bar number for the record.

ATTORNEY: Good morning, Officer Reynolds. My name is Sarah Evans, and my bar number is 1234567.

OFFICER: Thank you. You also have the right to present evidence in support of your application, and you have the right to request an interpreter if you do not speak English well enough to understand the questions and answer them accurately. But I understand that you don't need one.

APPLICANT: That is correct. My English is proficient.

OFFICER: Alright. Before we begin, I need to place you under oath. Please raise your right hand and repeat after me: Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

APPLICANT: I do swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God.

OFFICER: Thank you. Please be seated. Let’s start with some background information. Your name is…

APPLICANT: My name is Zein al-Din.

OFFICER: And your date of birth?

APPLICANT: July 12, 1982.

OFFICER: And your place of birth?

APPLICANT: Damascus, Syria.

OFFICER: Okay. And what is your current address in the United States?

APPLICANT: [Provides address].

OFFICER: Thank you. Now, Zein, your application indicates that you are seeking asylum based on fear of persecution due to your LGBTQ+ identity. Is that correct?

APPLICANT: Yes, that is correct. I identify as non-binary.

OFFICER: Can you tell me more about how you came to understand and identify as non-binary?

APPLICANT: It's... it's been a long journey of self-discovery. Even as a child, I never felt like I fit neatly into the traditional roles for boys or girls. I always felt a disconnect. As I got older, I started to explore different identities and came across the term "non-binary" and it just... resonated. It felt like it described who I am internally. It’s not a choice; it’s just… me.

OFFICER: And when did you first start to express your gender identity outwardly?

APPLICANT: Not really until… maybe five years ago. In Syria, it was too dangerous. I had to hide it. I tried to conform, but it was exhausting and painful. I started small, with subtle things like wearing clothing that felt more comfortable, things only I would notice. But even those small acts made me feel… more alive, more like myself.

OFFICER: You mentioned it was dangerous. Can you elaborate on the dangers you faced in Syria as someone who is non-binary?

APPLICANT: Of course. In Syria, LGBTQ+ people face constant discrimination and violence. The laws are vague but often used to target us. There’s Article 520 of the penal code, which prohibits "indecent acts" and can be interpreted to include anything outside of traditional gender roles or relationships. The police often use this law to harass, arrest, and even torture LGBTQ+ individuals. But it's not just the government. Society itself is very conservative and intolerant. Family members might disown you, neighbors might harass you, and you could lose your job.

OFFICER: Your application mentions that you completed secondary education. Can you tell me about that?

APPLICANT: Yes, I completed my secondary education at [Name of School] in Damascus. It was a standard secondary school, providing a general education. I finished with a focus on scientific studies. I didn't pursue a university degree due to the financial situation of my family, and honestly, I was worried about the discrimination I might face as a student there.

OFFICER: And after secondary school, what did you do professionally?

APPLICANT: I worked in healthcare. I started as a nursing assistant and eventually became a phlebotomist. I worked at a private clinic in Damascus for about 12 years.

OFFICER: Can you describe your duties as a phlebotomist?

APPLICANT: Of course. I was responsible for drawing blood from patients for various tests, preparing the samples for the lab, and ensuring the patient's comfort and safety. I also kept records and assisted with other administrative tasks as needed. It was a demanding job, but I found it rewarding to help people.

OFFICER: Now, let's talk about your reasons for leaving Syria. You mentioned fear of persecution. Can you describe specific incidents of persecution or threats you experienced?

APPLICANT: Yes. The most significant incident happened about three years ago. It was… terrifying. I was walking home from work late one night, around 11 pm. I was wearing clothes that I felt comfortable in, clothes that reflected how I felt inside – looser fitting and less traditionally masculine. A group of men stopped me. They started shouting slurs, calling me names, accusing me of being immoral and a disgrace.

OFFICER: Do you remember what they said specifically?

APPLICANT: Some of the words, yes. They called me a *mukhannath*, which is a derogatory term for someone who is effeminate. They said I was an abomination, that I was bringing shame to the neighborhood. They pushed me against a wall and started hitting me. One of them had a knife and threatened to cut me.

OFFICER: Did they cut you?

APPLICANT: No, thankfully. A neighbor heard the commotion and came outside. He shouted at them to leave me alone, and they eventually ran off. But I was badly shaken. I had bruises and cuts. I didn’t go to the police; I was too afraid. I knew they wouldn't help me, and they might even arrest me for being… who I am.

OFFICER: Did you seek medical attention?

APPLICANT: No. I cleaned my wounds myself. I was too afraid to go to a hospital. I didn’t want to risk being reported to the authorities.

OFFICER: Can you describe any other incidents of discrimination or harassment you faced?

APPLICANT: There were… constant microaggressions. People staring, whispering, making comments about my appearance. Landlords refused to rent to me. I was passed over for promotions at work, even though I was qualified. I was afraid to be myself, afraid to express my identity openly. The fear was always there, a constant weight on my shoulders.

OFFICER: Did you ever try to relocate to a different part of Syria to avoid these problems?

APPLICANT: I considered it, but I didn't think it would make much of a difference. The discrimination is widespread throughout the country. And moving would have been expensive and difficult. I didn’t have the resources. Besides, my family was in Damascus. Moving far away from them would have been isolating.

OFFICER: Did you ever report any of these incidents to the authorities?

APPLICANT: No. Reporting to the police would have been incredibly dangerous. The police are not there to protect LGBTQ+ people; they are often the ones who persecute us. I was too afraid to take that risk.

OFFICER: Why do you believe you cannot return to Syria?

APPLICANT: Because the situation has only gotten worse. The war has created even more instability and intolerance. Extremist groups have gained influence, and they are even more hostile towards LGBTQ+ people. The government is preoccupied with the war and has little interest in protecting vulnerable populations. I am certain that if I returned to Syria, I would face persecution, violence, and possibly even death. I can't go back.

OFFICER: What evidence have you submitted to support your asylum claim?

APPLICANT: I have submitted a personal statement detailing my experiences, as well as country condition reports from organizations like Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International that document the persecution of LGBTQ+ people in Syria. I have also included letters from friends in Syria who can attest to the dangers I would face if I returned. And a psychological evaluation from a therapist here in the US detailing the trauma I've experienced.

ATTORNEY: We also submitted an expert declaration from Dr. [Expert's Name], a specialist on LGBTQ+ rights in the Middle East, which provides further context and corroboration.

OFFICER: Thank you, Ms. Evans. Zein, are any members of your family also at risk in Syria because of your identity?

APPLICANT: My family… it’s complicated. They know I’m different, but we don't really talk about it openly. They love me, I think, but they don't fully understand. I worry that they could face repercussions if people found out about me, but I don't have any direct evidence of that. They are, however, at risk because of the ongoing war.

OFFICER: What is your family situation now? Are your parents still alive?

APPLICANT: Yes, both my parents are still alive. They are still in Damascus. I have two younger brothers, both of whom are married with children. They are also still in Syria.

OFFICER: Have you been in contact with them recently?

APPLICANT: Yes, I try to call them as often as I can, but the phone lines are not always reliable. I mostly communicate with them through WhatsApp.

OFFICER: Let's talk about your travel to the United States. When did you arrive?

APPLICANT: I arrived on June 15, 2023.

OFFICER: And how did you enter the United States?

APPLICANT: I came on a tourist visa. I applied for it before things got even worse, hoping for a chance for a better life.

OFFICER: Did you intend to seek asylum when you applied for the tourist visa?

APPLICANT: No, not initially. I hoped things would get better in Syria, but they didn't. After being here for a few months and seeing the opportunities and the relative safety, I realized I couldn't go back. It was a difficult decision, but I knew it was the right one for my safety and well-being.

OFFICER: What are your plans if you are granted asylum in the United States?

APPLICANT: I want to continue working in healthcare. I have already started the process of getting my phlebotomy certification recognized here. I also want to become involved in LGBTQ+ advocacy and help others who are facing similar challenges. I want to build a life here, a life where I can be myself without fear.

OFFICER: You mentioned starting the process of getting your certification recognized. What steps have you taken so far?

APPLICANT: I contacted the National Phlebotomy Association and they have evaluated my credentials from Syria. They told me I need to take a certification exam. I am studying for it now. I also plan to volunteer at a local clinic to gain experience in the U.S. healthcare system.

OFFICER: Do you have any questions for me at this time?

APPLICANT: No, I don’t think so. Thank you for your time.

ATTORNEY: Officer, I just want to add that Zein has been incredibly proactive in seeking support and resources since arriving in the United States. They have connected with local LGBTQ+ organizations and have been attending support groups. This demonstrates their commitment to integrating into American society and contributing to the community.

OFFICER: Thank you, Ms. Evans. I appreciate that information. Zein, I have reviewed your application and the supporting documentation. I also appreciate you answering all my questions today. I need to inform you that I am not making a decision on your case today. The information you provided will be reviewed, and you will be notified of a decision in writing. Do you understand?

APPLICANT: Yes, I understand. Thank you.

OFFICER: Thank you for your time. This interview is concluded.
