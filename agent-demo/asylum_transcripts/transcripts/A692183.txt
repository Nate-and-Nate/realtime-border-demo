OFFICER: Good morning. My name is Officer Miller, and this is an asylum interview. I need to swear you in before we begin. Please raise your right hand and repeat after me: "I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God."

APPLICANT: I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God.

ATTORNEY: That is correct. Maria Rodriguez, representing Mr. Dubois.

OFFICER: Ms. Rodriguez, do you have any preliminary statements or objections?

ATTORNEY: No, Officer, not at this time.

OFFICER: Alright, Mr. Dubois, I understand you are seeking asylum in the United States based on a fear of persecution in Haiti due to your race. Is that correct?

APPLICANT: Yes, that is correct.

OFFICER: Let's start with your background. You stated your name is Jean-Pierre Dubois, born August 12, 1979. Where in Haiti were you born?

APPLICANT: I was born in Port-au-Prince.

OFFICER: And can you tell me about your family?

APPLICANT: Yes. I have… had… a wife, Marie. And we have three children. Twins, a boy and a girl, they are 14. And another daughter, she is 10. They are… they are still in Haiti.

OFFICER: They are listed as dependents on your application. What is their current situation? Are they safe?

APPLICANT: (hesitates) They are… as safe as they can be. It is difficult. I worry about them every day.

OFFICER: We will discuss that in more detail later. Let's move on to your education. You indicated on your application that you have a Master's degree. Can you tell me where you obtained that degree and what you studied?

APPLICANT: Yes, I have a Master's degree in Education. I received it from… (pauses) from the Université d'État d'Haïti, in Port-au-Prince.

OFFICER: Can you provide more details about the program? When did you start and finish, and what was your area of specialization?

APPLICANT: I started in… let me think… in 2004, and I finished in 2007. My specialization was… curriculum development.

OFFICER: Curriculum development. And after you received your degree, what kind of work did you do?

APPLICANT: I worked as a teacher. And then… then I became a principal.

OFFICER: Where did you work as a teacher and principal? Can you give me the names of the schools?

APPLICANT: I worked at… at École Nationale de Carrefour-Feuilles as a teacher. And then I was principal at… at a small private school, École Lumière.

OFFICER: École Lumière. How long were you a teacher at École Nationale de Carrefour-Feuilles?

APPLICANT: About… about five years.

OFFICER: And how long were you the principal at École Lumière?

APPLICANT: Only… only about two years.

OFFICER: Why did you leave that position?

APPLICANT: Because… because of the problems. The… the violence.

OFFICER: We will get to the violence shortly. But before that, can you describe your responsibilities as a principal? What did your day-to-day work involve?

APPLICANT: I was responsible for… everything. The budget, the staff, the students, the… the curriculum. Making sure the school ran smoothly. Dealing with parents. It was… a lot of work.

OFFICER: Now, let's talk about why you left Haiti. You are claiming persecution based on your race. Can you explain the specific circumstances that led you to fear for your safety and the safety of your family?

APPLICANT: It started… well, it has always been there, the discrimination. But it got worse. Much worse. Because… because I am dark-skinned.

OFFICER: Can you provide specific examples of this increased discrimination?

APPLICANT: Yes. The… the gangs. They started targeting people like me. They would… they would harass us, demand money. They said we were… inferior. Less than them.

OFFICER: Can you give me specific dates and locations of these incidents?

APPLICANT: (hesitates) It was… it was ongoing. It happened… mostly in my neighborhood. Carrefour-Feuilles. It started… I think it was around 2021.

OFFICER: Can you recall any specific incidents in 2021?

APPLICANT: Yes… yes, there was one time… I was walking home from the market. And some men stopped me. They… they insulted me. They called me names. They said I was… a *nèg*. They demanded money.

OFFICER: Did they physically harm you?

APPLICANT: No, not that time. But they threatened me. They said they would… they would hurt me if I didn't give them money.

OFFICER: Did you report this incident to the police?

APPLICANT: No. The police… they are no help. They are often… involved with the gangs.

OFFICER: Were there other incidents after that one?

APPLICANT: Yes. Many. They… they became more frequent. More violent.

OFFICER: Can you describe another incident?

APPLICANT: One time… it was in 2022… I was driving to work. And my car was stopped by… by a group of men. They were armed. They… they dragged me out of the car. They beat me.

OFFICER: Where did this happen?

APPLICANT: It happened on… on Rue de la République.

OFFICER: What injuries did you sustain?

APPLICANT: I… I had bruises. And… and a broken rib. I went to the doctor.

OFFICER: Do you have any medical records to support this claim?

APPLICANT: No… no, I don't. I didn't… I didn't keep them.

OFFICER: Why not?

APPLICANT: I… I was afraid. Afraid they would find out. Afraid they would come after me again.

OFFICER: You mentioned you were a principal at École Lumière. Was this incident related to your work?

APPLICANT: No… no, I don't think so. It was just… because of my race.

OFFICER: Did these gangs target other people in your neighborhood who were also dark-skinned?

APPLICANT: Yes. Many.

OFFICER: Do you have any evidence, such as police reports, news articles, or witness statements, to corroborate your claims of widespread targeting of dark-skinned individuals in your neighborhood?

APPLICANT: No… I don't have… specific evidence. But everyone knows. It is… it is common knowledge.

OFFICER: Did you ever try to relocate to a safer part of Haiti?

APPLICANT: Yes. We tried. We moved to… to Pétion-Ville. But it was… it was not much better. The gangs are everywhere.

OFFICER: How long did you live in Pétion-Ville?

APPLICANT: About… about six months.

OFFICER: Why did you move back to Carrefour-Feuilles?

APPLICANT: We… we ran out of money. Pétion-Ville is… expensive. We could not afford to live there anymore.

OFFICER: So, you moved back to the same neighborhood where you had experienced these incidents?

APPLICANT: (hesitates) Yes.

OFFICER: Why would you return to a place where you feared for your life?

APPLICANT: We… we had no choice. We had nowhere else to go.

OFFICER: Let's talk about your departure from Haiti. When did you leave, and what route did you take to the United States?

APPLICANT: I left in… in January of this year. I flew to… to the Dominican Republic. And then… then I took a bus to Mexico. And then… then I crossed the border into the United States.

OFFICER: Where did you cross the border?

APPLICANT: In… in Texas.

OFFICER: You entered without inspection, correct?

APPLICANT: Yes.

OFFICER: Why did you choose to come to the United States?

APPLICANT: Because… because I knew I would be safe here. I knew I could find help.

OFFICER: Do you have any family or friends in the United States?

APPLICANT: No.

OFFICER: What do you plan to do if you are granted asylum?

APPLICANT: I want to… to work. I want to use my education. I want to teach. I want to help people.

OFFICER: You mentioned you have a Master's degree in Curriculum Development. Have you researched the requirements for teaching in the United States? Are you aware that your credentials may not be directly transferable?

APPLICANT: (hesitates) I… I have not researched it in detail. But I am willing to… to do whatever it takes. To learn. To study. To get certified.

OFFICER: You stated that you worked as a teacher for five years and then as a principal for two years. This totals seven years of work experience. However, your resume, which was submitted with your application, indicates that you worked as a principal for eight years, from 2014 to 2022. Can you explain this discrepancy?

APPLICANT: (long pause) There… there must be a mistake. I… I am not sure how that happened. My memory is not so good these days.

OFFICER: Ms. Rodriguez, do you have any clarification on this issue?

ATTORNEY: Officer, my client has been through a great deal of trauma. There may be some inconsistencies in his recollection, but his core claim remains valid.

OFFICER: Mr. Dubois, let's go back to your family. You said your wife and children are still in Haiti. Why didn't they come with you?

APPLICANT: It was… too dangerous. And… and too expensive. I wanted to come first, to… to establish myself. To find a safe place. And then… then I would bring them.

OFFICER: Do you have any plans to petition for them to join you if you are granted asylum?

APPLICANT: Yes. That is my… my greatest wish.

OFFICER: Are they also facing persecution because of your race?

APPLICANT: Yes. Because they are… related to me.

OFFICER: Can you provide any specific examples of how they have been targeted since you left?

APPLICANT: (hesitates) I… I have heard… stories. From friends. They say… they say the gangs are watching them.

OFFICER: What kind of stories? Can you be specific?

APPLICANT: They say… they say the gangs have been asking about me. Looking for me. They are… they are threatening Marie.

OFFICER: Do you have any direct communication with your wife?

APPLICANT: Yes. Sometimes. When the… when the internet is working.

OFFICER: Do you have any messages or emails from her describing these threats?

APPLICANT: No… no, I don't. We… we don't want to put anything in writing. It is too dangerous.

OFFICER: Mr. Dubois, you are asking for protection from the United States government. It is important that you provide as much detail and evidence as possible to support your claim. The inconsistencies in your testimony and the lack of corroborating evidence raise concerns about your credibility.

APPLICANT: I am telling the truth. I am afraid. I am afraid for my family.

OFFICER: I understand. Thank you for your testimony. Do you have anything else you would like to add?

APPLICANT: No… I think that is all.

OFFICER: Ms. Rodriguez, do you have any final statements?

ATTORNEY: Yes, Officer. While I acknowledge that there may be some minor inconsistencies in my client's testimony, I believe that he has established a credible fear of persecution based on his race. He is a well-educated individual who has contributed to his community. He deserves the protection of the United States.

OFFICER: Thank you. This concludes the interview. We will notify you of our decision in writing.
