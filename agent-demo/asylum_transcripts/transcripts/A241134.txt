INTERVIEW BEGINS

OFFICER: Good morning, Ms. Rodriguez. My name is Officer Miller, and this is Officer Johnson. We are Asylum Officers with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. With me today is a certified interpreter, who will be translating everything we say, and everything you say, so please speak clearly and at a moderate pace. Also present is your attorney, Ms. Alvarez.

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Good morning.

OFFICER: Ms. Rodriguez, as you know, you have applied for asylum in the United States. This interview is to determine whether you meet the requirements for asylum under U.S. law. I need to advise you that you are under oath. Do you understand?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes, I understand.

OFFICER: Please raise your right hand and repeat after me: "I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God."

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) "I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God."

OFFICER: Thank you. Please be seated. Ms. Alvarez, do you have any preliminary remarks or questions before we begin?

ATTORNEY: No, Officer, thank you. We are ready to proceed.

OFFICER: Alright, Ms. Rodriguez, let's start with some background information. Can you please state your full name and date of birth for the record?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) My name is Sofia Elena Rodriguez Vargas. My date of birth is March 10, 1982.

OFFICER: And where were you born?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) In Bogota, Colombia.

OFFICER: Could you please describe your educational background?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I have a Bachelor's degree in Hospitality Management from the Universidad de la Sabana in Bogota.

OFFICER: And when did you graduate?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) In 2004.

OFFICER: What did you study in your bachelor's program? What kind of classes did you take?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I took classes in hotel administration, restaurant management, tourism, accounting, marketing, and customer service. It was a very practical program, focused on the service industry.

OFFICER: After graduating, what kind of work did you do?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I worked in various roles in the hospitality industry. I started as a receptionist at a hotel, then I worked as a restaurant server, and later as a supervisor in a catering company. Before I left Colombia, I was the assistant manager at a small boutique hotel.

OFFICER: Can you tell me about your role as assistant manager? What did your responsibilities include?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I was responsible for overseeing the daily operations of the hotel, managing staff schedules, handling customer complaints, and ensuring the hotel met its financial goals. I also helped with marketing and sales efforts.

OFFICER: I see. Now, Ms. Rodriguez, I want to understand the reasons why you left Colombia and are seeking asylum here in the United States. Can you tell me what happened that made you afraid to stay in Colombia?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) It's difficult to explain... It started with unwanted attention at my job. I was targeted because I was a single woman.

OFFICER: Targeted by whom?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) By a local criminal group... they called themselves "Los Halcones."

OFFICER: Can you spell that for me?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) (Through interpreter) H-A-L-C-O-N-E-S.

OFFICER: And what kind of unwanted attention did they give you?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) At first, it was just comments, you know? Saying I was beautiful, asking me out. I ignored them. But then they started coming to the hotel more often. They would demand free drinks, free rooms… they became very aggressive.

OFFICER: Did you report this to the police?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) No, never. Everyone knows the police are corrupt. They are either paid off by the gangs or too afraid to do anything. Reporting them would have made things worse.

OFFICER: What made you think that reporting to the police would make things worse? Did you have any specific experiences that led you to believe this?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes. I knew someone, a colleague, whose family owned a small business. They were being extorted by a similar group. They went to the police, and the next day, the business was burned to the ground. The police did nothing. Everyone knows this happens.

OFFICER: I understand. Can you give me specific dates or timeframes for when these incidents with "Los Halcones" occurred at the hotel?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) It started around July of 2021. It escalated quickly over the next few months, until I left in January 2022.

OFFICER: Can you describe a specific incident that made you fear for your safety?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) One night, in December 2021, I was closing up the hotel. Two of them were waiting for me outside. They grabbed me, pushed me into a car, and drove me to a secluded place. They threatened me, said they knew where I lived, who my family was. They said if I didn't cooperate with them, they would hurt me and my family.

OFFICER: What did they want you to cooperate with them on?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) They wanted me to let them use the hotel for their… activities. They wanted me to look the other way when they brought in drugs, weapons, and other… things. They also wanted me to give them information about the hotel's guests.

OFFICER: Did you cooperate with them?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) No! I refused. I told them I would quit my job first.

OFFICER: What happened after you refused?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) They got very angry. They slapped me, threatened me again, and then they drove me back to the hotel. They said they would be watching me.

OFFICER: Did you quit your job?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes, the very next day. I was terrified.

OFFICER: What did you do after you quit your job?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I stayed with my sister for a few weeks. I was afraid to go out. I was constantly looking over my shoulder.

OFFICER: Did you consider moving to another city in Colombia?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes, I thought about it. But I didn't have enough money to start over somewhere new. And I was afraid they would find me. They seemed to have connections everywhere. Plus, the problems with these groups are everywhere in Colombia. It's not safe anywhere.

OFFICER: You mentioned your sister. Does she live in Bogota as well?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes, she does.

OFFICER: Is she aware of what happened to you?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes, I told her everything. She was very worried about me.

OFFICER: Is she in danger because of what happened to you?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I don't know for sure. But I worry about her. She still lives in the same apartment, and they know she is my sister.

OFFICER: Did you seek any other form of protection or assistance besides going to the police?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) No. I didn’t know where to turn. I felt completely alone and helpless.

OFFICER: Ms. Rodriguez, you entered the United States legally with a tourist visa. Is that correct?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes, that is correct.

OFFICER: When did you enter the United States, and where did you enter?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I arrived in Miami on January 28, 2022.

OFFICER: On a B2 tourist visa?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes.

OFFICER: What was your intention when you came to the United States? Did you intend to seek asylum when you first arrived?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) No, not at first. I just wanted to get away from the danger. I thought maybe I could visit some friends, clear my head, and then go back to Colombia. But after being here for a few months, I realized I couldn't go back. It was too dangerous. That's when I decided to apply for asylum.

OFFICER: You overstayed your visa, and then applied for asylum. Is that right?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes, that's right.

OFFICER: Ms. Rodriguez, do you have any documents or other evidence to support your claims?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes, I have submitted a copy of my Bachelor's degree, my work contract from the hotel, and an affidavit from my sister describing what happened after I quit my job. I also have some photos of the hotel.

OFFICER: We have those documents in your file. Do you have any other documents that you haven't submitted yet?

ATTORNEY: Officer, we are in the process of gathering additional evidence, including news articles about the activities of "Los Halcones" in the Bogota area. We will submit those as soon as possible.

OFFICER: Thank you, Ms. Alvarez. Ms. Rodriguez, what are your plans if you are granted asylum in the United States?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I want to work and contribute to this country. I have many years of experience in the hospitality industry. I would like to find a job in a hotel or restaurant, maybe even start my own business someday. I also want to improve my English and become a productive member of society.

OFFICER: Have you started taking English classes?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes, I am taking classes twice a week at a local community center. It's difficult, but I am learning.

OFFICER: Do you have any family members in the United States?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) No, just friends.

OFFICER: You said your sister is still in Colombia. Do you have any other family members there?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) My parents are deceased. I have some cousins, but I am not very close to them.

OFFICER: Do you believe your sister is in danger because of the events you described?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I worry about her constantly. I try to call her every day, but I am afraid to talk too much on the phone. I don't want to put her at risk.

OFFICER: Ms. Rodriguez, can you describe "Los Halcones" in more detail? What did they look like? How many members are there?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) They were mostly young men, in their twenties and thirties. They were always well-dressed, but they had a very intimidating presence. I don't know how many members there are, but I know they are a large and powerful group. They operate in many parts of the city.

OFFICER: Did they ever mention any names?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) No, never. They were very careful.

OFFICER: Ms. Rodriguez, you mentioned you were working legally in Colombia before coming to the US. Why didn't you attempt to seek legal protection in the US before your visa expired?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I was hoping the situation would resolve itself, but it didn’t. It only got worse. I was scared and didn’t know what to do. I was also in shock.

OFFICER: Okay. Ms. Rodriguez, do you have anything else you would like to add before we conclude this interview?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I just want to say that I am telling the truth. I am afraid to go back to Colombia. I believe my life is in danger. I am asking for your help.

OFFICER: Ms. Alvarez, do you have any further comments or questions for your client?

ATTORNEY: No, Officer, thank you. We believe Ms. Rodriguez has presented a credible case for asylum. We will submit the additional evidence as soon as possible.

OFFICER: Thank you. Ms. Rodriguez, this concludes our interview. We will review your application and the evidence you have presented, and we will notify you of our decision in writing.

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Thank you.

INTERVIEW ENDS

**Asylum Officer Notes:**

The applicant presented a claim for asylum based on fear of persecution due to membership in a particular social group (single women business owners) and possibly imputed political opinion (refusal to cooperate with criminal group).

The applicant's testimony regarding the threats and harassment by "Los Halcones" raises serious concerns. Her fear of returning to Colombia appears genuine. Her testimony regarding the group's reach, and the corruption of the police, suggests a breakdown of state protection.

However, several aspects of the case require further investigation:

*   The applicant's delay in seeking asylum after entering the United States on a tourist visa needs to be further explored.
*   The specific connection between the applicant's gender and her targeting by the criminal group needs clarification.
*   Corroborating evidence regarding the existence and activities of "Los Halcones" is needed.
*   The risk to her sister in Colombia needs to be assessed.

Given these complexities and the need for further fact-finding, I am referring this case to the Immigration Court for further review.
