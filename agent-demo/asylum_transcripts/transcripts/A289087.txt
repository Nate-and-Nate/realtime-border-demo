INTERVIEW BEGINS

OFFICER: Good morning, Madame Dubois. My name is Officer Miller, and this is Officer Jones. We’re here today to conduct your asylum interview. As you know, you’ve applied for asylum in the United States. I need to inform you that you are not required to answer any questions, but a refusal to answer questions may affect your application. Do you understand?

APPLICANT: Yes, I understand.

OFFICER: Before we begin, I need to swear you in. Please raise your right hand and repeat after me: "Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?"

APPLICANT: I do.

OFFICER: Thank you. And is this… Mr. Peterson?

ATTORNEY: Yes, good morning, Officer Miller. I am Jean-Luc Peterson, representing Madame Dubois.

OFFICER: Good morning, Mr. Peterson. Alright, Madame Dubois, let’s begin. Please state your full name and date of birth for the record.

APPLICANT: My full name is Marie-Therese Dubois, and my date of birth is June 12, 1958.

OFFICER: And your A-number is?

APPLICANT: A289087.

OFFICER: Thank you. Now, Madame Dubois, you’ve indicated on your application that you are seeking asylum based on fear of persecution due to your membership in a particular social group. Can you please elaborate on this?

APPLICANT: Yes. I am seeking asylum because I fear for my life if I return to Haiti. I am a member of a business collective of female entrepreneurs in Port-au-Prince, and this group has been targeted by gangs who seek to extort money and control economic activity.

OFFICER: Let’s start with your background. Can you tell me about your life in Haiti, your education, and your professional experience?

APPLICANT: Of course. I was born and raised in Port-au-Prince. I attended the University of Haiti, where I earned a bachelor’s degree in economics. After that, I received a scholarship to study in France, where I obtained my Master's degree in Finance from HEC Paris. I returned to Haiti with the hopes of contributing to the country's economic development.

OFFICER: And what did you do professionally after returning to Haiti?

APPLICANT: I worked for several years at a local bank, specializing in small business loans. I then started my own consulting firm, providing financial advice to small and medium-sized businesses. I particularly focused on helping women entrepreneurs secure funding and grow their businesses.

OFFICER: Tell me more about this business collective you mentioned. When did it form, and what was its purpose?

APPLICANT: It started about five years ago. We saw that women-owned businesses were facing unique challenges, especially in accessing capital and navigating the complex regulatory environment. So, we formed a collective – "Fanm Ekonomik Fò" – which means "Strong Economic Women" in Creole. We provided mutual support, shared resources, and advocated for policies that would benefit women entrepreneurs.

OFFICER: And how did this collective attract the attention of the gangs?

APPLICANT: As we became more successful and our members' businesses grew, we became targets. The gangs saw us as a source of easy money. They started by demanding "protection" money – extortion, basically. They would send messages, sometimes through intermediaries, sometimes directly. The demands escalated over time.

OFFICER: Can you give me specific examples of these demands and threats?

APPLICANT: Yes. In October of 2022, I received a phone call from an unknown number. The voice on the other end said, "Madame Dubois, we know you run Fanm Ekonomik Fò. Your businesses are doing well. It would be a shame if something happened to them… or to you. You need to pay us 50,000 gourdes per month, per business affiliated with the organization." I refused.

OFFICER: And what happened after you refused?

APPLICANT: A week later, one of our members, Madame Celine, who owned a small bakery, had her shop vandalized. The windows were smashed, and the word "Peye" – "Pay" in Creole – was spray-painted on the walls. She reported it to the police, but they did nothing.

OFFICER: Did you report the phone call to the police?

APPLICANT: Yes, I did. But the police are… overwhelmed. They lack resources, and in some cases, they are even complicit with the gangs. The officer who took my report basically told me there was nothing they could do. He advised me to pay the money.

OFFICER: Did the extortion attempts continue?

APPLICANT: Yes, they did. In December of 2022, another member, Madame Isabelle, who ran a small clothing boutique, was physically assaulted. She was walking home from work when two men on a motorcycle attacked her. They didn't steal anything; they just beat her. She was hospitalized. Again, she reported it to the police, but no one was ever arrested.

OFFICER: Mr. Peterson, do you have any comments at this time?

ATTORNEY: Officer, we have submitted medical records documenting Madame Isabelle's injuries and police reports related to the incidents described by Madame Dubois. We believe this evidence corroborates her testimony.

OFFICER: Thank you, Mr. Peterson. Madame Dubois, did you ever consider relocating to another part of Haiti to avoid the gangs?

APPLICANT: I did. I thought about moving to Cap-Haïtien, which is considered safer than Port-au-Prince. But the gangs are expanding their reach. Even if I moved, I wouldn't be safe. And more importantly, my family… my husband, my children, my grandchildren… they would still be in danger. I couldn't leave them behind.

OFFICER: You mentioned your family. Who are the dependent family members listed on your application?

APPLICANT: My husband, Jean-Pierre Dubois, and my five grandchildren: Sophie, age 16; Marc, age 14; Isabelle, age 12; Pierre, age 10; and Chloe, age 8. Their parents… my daughter and son-in-law… they were killed in the 2010 earthquake. I am their legal guardian.

OFFICER: I am sorry to hear that. Are your grandchildren also at risk from the gangs?

APPLICANT: Absolutely. The gangs are increasingly targeting young people, recruiting them, or worse. I fear for their safety every single day. That's why I had to leave. I couldn't bear the thought of something happening to them.

OFFICER: When did you decide to leave Haiti, and what was your route to the United States?

APPLICANT: I decided to leave in January of 2023, after… after I received a direct threat. I received a letter at my home. It contained a picture of my granddaughter, Sophie, with a red X over her face. The letter said, "If you don't pay, she will be next." I knew I had to get us out.

OFFICER: Can you provide that letter as evidence?

APPLICANT: Yes, it was submitted with my application.

ATTORNEY: It is Exhibit C, Officer.

OFFICER: Thank you. And the route?

APPLICANT: I sold everything I had – my house, my business, my car – to raise money for plane tickets. We flew from Port-au-Prince to Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic. From there, we flew to Mexico City, and then to Tijuana. We crossed the border into the United States on February 15, 2023, and presented ourselves to immigration officials.

OFFICER: Madame Dubois, do you have any connections to the United States? Did you know anyone here before you arrived?

APPLICANT: No, not really. I had a former classmate from HEC Paris who lives in New York. I contacted him after I arrived, and he has been very helpful in providing support and guidance. But I didn't know him well before.

OFFICER: If granted asylum, what are your plans for the future?

APPLICANT: I want to rebuild my life and provide a safe and stable environment for my grandchildren. I also want to use my skills and experience to contribute to the American economy. I believe my background in finance and business consulting could be valuable here. I am particularly interested in working with non-profit organizations that support small businesses and women entrepreneurs. I also want to learn more about the American financial system and obtain any necessary certifications to practice here.

OFFICER: Have you ever been arrested or convicted of a crime, either in Haiti or in any other country?

APPLICANT: No, never.

OFFICER: Have you ever been a member of any political organization or group that has used violence?

APPLICANT: Absolutely not. I believe in peaceful solutions and democratic processes.

OFFICER: Madame Dubois, why can’t you return to Haiti?

APPLICANT: Because I am certain I will be killed. And my grandchildren… they will be at even greater risk. The gangs know who I am. They know where my family lives. They will not forget. The situation in Haiti is only getting worse. The government is unable to control the gangs, and there is no rule of law. There is no protection for people like me.

OFFICER: You mentioned the 2010 earthquake. How did that impact your family and your business?

APPLICANT: The earthquake was devastating. My daughter and son-in-law were killed when their house collapsed. I was fortunate to survive, but my business was severely damaged. It took me years to rebuild. The earthquake also created a climate of instability and lawlessness that contributed to the rise of the gangs.

OFFICER: I understand. Mr. Peterson, do you have any further questions for your client?

ATTORNEY: Yes, just a few clarifying points, Officer. Madame Dubois, can you elaborate on the specific steps you took to protect yourself and your family before leaving Haiti?

APPLICANT: Certainly. Besides reporting the threats to the police, I also hired private security to protect my home and my grandchildren. But it was very expensive, and I couldn't afford it for long. I also tried to keep a low profile and avoid drawing attention to myself. But it was difficult because of my position in the business collective.

ATTORNEY: And can you reiterate why you believe the Haitian authorities are unable or unwilling to protect you?

APPLICANT: The police are overwhelmed, under-resourced, and often corrupt. They are simply unable to control the gangs. And in some cases, they are even working with them. There is no justice in Haiti. There is no rule of law.

ATTORNEY: Thank you, Madame Dubois. That's all, Officer.

OFFICER: Thank you, Mr. Peterson. Madame Dubois, Officer Jones and I have reviewed your application and the supporting documents you submitted. We appreciate you taking the time to speak with us today. We will notify you of our decision in writing as soon as possible.

APPLICANT: Thank you, Officer. I appreciate your time and consideration.

OFFICER: You're welcome.
