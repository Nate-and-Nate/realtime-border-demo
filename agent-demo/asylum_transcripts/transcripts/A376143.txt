INTERVIEW BEGINS

OFFICER: Good morning. My name is Officer Miller, and I'm an asylum officer with USCIS. This is an interview regarding your application for asylum in the United States. Before we begin, I need to make sure you understand the process and that you are telling the truth.

This interview is being recorded. The information you provide will be used to determine whether you qualify for asylum. You have the right to have an attorney present, but I understand you are proceeding without one today. Is that correct?

APPLICANT: Yes, that is correct.

OFFICER: Okay. I need you to raise your right hand and swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God.

APPLICANT: I swear.

OFFICER: Thank you. Please state your full name and date of birth for the record.

APPLICANT: My name is Orlando Perez. My date of birth is November 12, 1994.

OFFICER: Thank you. Can you spell your last name for me, please?

APPLICANT: P-E-R-E-Z.

OFFICER: Thank you. And you identify as non-binary, is that correct?

APPLICANT: Yes, that is correct. I prefer they/them pronouns.

OFFICER: Understood. I will do my best to respect your pronouns during this interview. Let’s start with your background. Where in Cuba were you born and raised?

APPLICANT: I was born and raised in a small town called San Cristobal, in the province of Artemisa.

OFFICER: Can you describe San Cristobal for me? What was it like growing up there?

APPLICANT: It’s… it’s a rural town. Mostly farms. My family, we had a small farm. We grew tobacco, mostly. Life was simple, hard work.

OFFICER: And what was your role on the farm?

APPLICANT: I did everything. Planting, harvesting, drying the tobacco leaves. Feeding the animals. Whatever needed doing.

OFFICER: You indicated on your application that you completed primary education. Can you tell me about that? What school did you attend and for how long?

APPLICANT: I went to the local school in San Cristobal. Escuela Primaria "Heroes de Yaguajay". I went until I was… maybe 11 years old? Then I had to work full-time on the farm.

OFFICER: So, you completed about five or six years of primary school?

APPLICANT: Something like that, yes.

OFFICER: Okay. You stated the basis for your asylum claim is fear of persecution based on religion. Can you tell me about your religious beliefs?

APPLICANT: I am… I follow Santeria. It’s a traditional Afro-Cuban religion.

OFFICER: How long have you practiced Santeria?

APPLICANT: Always. My family, they all practice Santeria. It’s been in my family for generations.

OFFICER: Can you describe some of the practices of Santeria?

APPLICANT: Well, there are… ceremonies. We honor the Orishas, the deities. There are offerings, drumming, dancing. It’s… it’s hard to explain. It's very personal.

OFFICER: I understand. Can you tell me why you fear persecution in Cuba because of your Santeria beliefs?

APPLICANT: Because… the government, they don’t like it. They say it’s superstitious. They prefer people to be… you know, loyal to the revolution, not to these… old traditions.

OFFICER: Can you give me specific examples of how you have been persecuted or fear persecution?

APPLICANT: Okay. So, there was this one time… maybe two years ago? The local police, they came to my house. They said they heard drumming late at night. They searched the house, looking for… I don’t know, drugs or something. They didn’t find anything, but they insulted us. They called us names. They said we were backwards and ignorant.

OFFICER: And was this the only incident with the police?

APPLICANT: No. There were other times. They would stop me on the street and ask where I was going. They would make comments about my… my clothes, my appearance. They knew I was different.

OFFICER: You said they made comments about your appearance. Can you elaborate on that?

APPLICANT: Because… well, I don’t always present as… male. Sometimes I wear clothes that are more… feminine. The police, they would make fun of me. They would call me names. They would say I was a disgrace to the revolution.

OFFICER: Did you ever report these incidents to the authorities?

APPLICANT: No. Who would I report them to? The police are the authorities. They wouldn’t help me.

OFFICER: Did these incidents happen often?

APPLICANT: Not… not every day. But enough to make me scared. Maybe once a month? Sometimes more, sometimes less.

OFFICER: You mentioned your family practices Santeria as well. Did they experience similar problems?

APPLICANT: Yes. My mother, she was also stopped by the police. They questioned her about our religious practices. They threatened to take away our land if we didn’t stop.

OFFICER: They threatened to take away your land? Did they ever try to take it?

APPLICANT: No, not yet. But that’s why I left. I was afraid they would. Our farm is everything to us. It’s how we survive.

OFFICER: Did you experience any other forms of discrimination or harassment because of your religion?

APPLICANT: Yes. Sometimes, people in the town would refuse to sell us things. They would say we were devil worshippers. It was hard to get supplies for the farm.

OFFICER: Can you provide any specific examples of businesses refusing to sell you supplies?

APPLICANT: Uh… well, there was the… the feed store. The owner, his name was… uh… Rafael. He told me he wouldn’t sell me any more feed because I was a “brujo,” a witch.

OFFICER: When did this happen?

APPLICANT: Maybe… six months before I left Cuba?

OFFICER: Did this Rafael own the only feed store in San Cristobal?

APPLICANT: No, there was another one. But it was further away, and the prices were higher.

OFFICER: Did you attempt to relocate to another part of Cuba to avoid these problems?

APPLICANT: No. My family, we are rooted in San Cristobal. Our farm is there. We couldn’t just leave everything behind.

OFFICER: You stated that you left Cuba because of these problems. Can you describe your journey to the United States?

APPLICANT: I flew to Mexico. Then I crossed the border into the United States.

OFFICER: How did you enter the United States?

APPLICANT: I crossed the border near Tijuana.

OFFICER: Did you have any assistance crossing the border?

APPLICANT: Yes. I paid someone to help me.

OFFICER: How much did you pay?

APPLICANT: I paid… $5,000.

OFFICER: Where did you get that money?

APPLICANT: I saved it up. From working on the farm.

OFFICER: Over how long a period did you save that money?

APPLICANT: Maybe… two years?

OFFICER: So you saved $2,500 a year as a farmer in Cuba? That seems like a significant amount. Can you explain how you were able to save so much?

APPLICANT: Well, we… we worked hard. And we didn’t spend much money. We grew our own food. We didn’t need much.

OFFICER: Do you have any documents or other evidence to support your claim?

APPLICANT: I have… some pictures. Of my family. And of our farm. I also have a letter from my mother.

OFFICER: Have you submitted these to USCIS?

APPLICANT: Yes, I submitted them with my application.

OFFICER: Okay. What are your plans if you are granted asylum in the United States?

APPLICANT: I want to work. I want to contribute to society. I know how to farm. Maybe I can find work on a farm here.

OFFICER: You have a primary education and experience farming tobacco. Do you have any other skills or training that might be useful in the United States?

APPLICANT: I… I’m a hard worker. I’m willing to learn. I can speak English, as you can hear.

OFFICER: Yes, your English is quite good. How did you learn English?

APPLICANT: I learned from… from books. And from watching movies.

OFFICER: Watching movies? You mentioned your town was very rural. Did you have access to these resources?

APPLICANT: Yes. A friend of mine had a… a DVD player. He would let me borrow movies.

OFFICER: I see. Are any members of your family at risk in Cuba if you are granted asylum here?

APPLICANT: Yes. My mother. She is still there. I am worried about her.

OFFICER: Has she experienced any specific threats or incidents since you left?

APPLICANT: Not that I know of. But I am still worried.

OFFICER: Do you believe that the government of Cuba is actively seeking to harm members of your family because you are seeking asylum in the United States?

APPLICANT: I don’t know. I hope not. But I can’t be sure.

OFFICER: Okay. Let’s go back to the incident with the police searching your house. You said they were looking for drugs. Is there a history of drug use or dealing in your family or in your neighborhood?

APPLICANT: No. No, never. They were just… making excuses.

OFFICER: So, you believe they targeted you specifically because of your religious beliefs and your gender expression?

APPLICANT: Yes.

OFFICER: But they didn't find anything illegal.

APPLICANT: No.

OFFICER: And you weren't physically harmed, correct?

APPLICANT: No, not physically.

OFFICER: Okay, one last question. In your asylum application, you mentioned attending certain Santeria ceremonies. Can you describe one of these ceremonies in detail, including the specific Orishas involved, the rituals performed, and the meaning behind them?

APPLICANT: (Hesitates) Um… well, there are different ceremonies for different Orishas. It depends on… what you need. I don’t really feel comfortable talking about it in detail. It’s very personal.

OFFICER: I understand. But to assess the credibility of your claim, it's important to understand your religious practices. Can you provide even a general description of a typical ceremony?

APPLICANT: (Long pause) Okay… Sometimes… we make offerings. To… to Yemaya, the Orisha of the sea. We offer her… fruit. And… and flowers. And we sing songs to her.

OFFICER: And what is the purpose of these offerings and songs?

APPLICANT: To… to ask for her blessings. To thank her for her protection.

OFFICER: Thank you. I don't have any further questions for you at this time. Do you have anything else you would like to add?

APPLICANT: No, I think I have said everything. I just hope you will believe me and grant me asylum. I can't go back to Cuba.

OFFICER: Thank you for your time and your testimony. I will review your application and the information you have provided, and you will be notified of the decision in writing.
