INTERVIEW BEGINS

OFFICER: Good morning, Mr. Rodriguez. My name is Officer Miller, and this is Officer Davis. We are asylum officers with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. We are here today to conduct an interview regarding your application for asylum in the United States. This interview is being conducted under oath, meaning you must tell the truth. Do you understand?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes, I understand.

OFFICER: Before we begin, please raise your right hand and repeat after me: “I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God.”

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God.

OFFICER: Thank you. Please be seated. Mr. Rodriguez, you have indicated on your application that you are seeking asylum based on a fear of persecution in Cuba due to your nationality. Is that correct?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes, that is correct.

OFFICER: Can you please state your full name for the record?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Ricardo Manuel Rodriguez Perez.

OFFICER: And what is your date of birth?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) March 12, 1979.

OFFICER: And you are a citizen of Cuba?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes, I am Cuban.

OFFICER: Mr. Rodriguez, let's start with some background information. Can you tell me about your life in Cuba? Where did you live, what did you do?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I lived in Havana, in the neighborhood of Vedado. I am… I was… a sculptor. I made sculptures. I studied at the Instituto Superior de Arte. The ISA. It is… was… my life.

OFFICER: You said you studied at the Instituto Superior de Arte. What degree did you obtain?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) A Bachelor’s degree in Fine Arts. I specialized in sculpture.

OFFICER: And after you graduated, what did you do professionally?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I worked as an independent artist. I… I tried to sell my sculptures. I exhibited in small galleries. Sometimes I got commissions. It was… difficult.

OFFICER: What kind of sculptures did you create? What was your style?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) My style… it was… contemporary. Modern. I used different materials – metal, wood, sometimes found objects. My work… it often… commented on… the political situation in Cuba. The restrictions, the lack of freedom.

OFFICER: Can you give me specific examples of how your work reflected the political situation?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes. One piece… it was a large cage made of barbed wire. Inside, there was a bird made of clay, trying to fly but unable to escape. It was… a symbol of the Cuban people. Another… I made a series of masks… faces… that were all identical, but each one was gagged. This was to show that the government wants everyone to be the same and to silence any dissent.

OFFICER: Did you ever face any problems or repercussions because of the political themes in your art?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes, many times. At first, it was subtle. Galleries would refuse to exhibit my work. Critics… they would ignore it or dismiss it as… as subversive. But then… it became more serious.

OFFICER: Can you describe a specific incident where you faced problems due to your art?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) In 2018… it was… October, I think… I had a small exhibition in a private home. It was not… official. Just friends and other artists. Someone… I don’t know who… reported me to the authorities. The next day… two men… they came to my house. They said they were from… the Ministry of Culture. They… they searched my studio. They confiscated some of my sculptures. They said my work was… disrespectful to the Revolution.

OFFICER: Did they arrest you at that time?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) No, not then. They… they warned me. They said if I continued to create art like that… there would be consequences.

OFFICER: And did you stop creating art with political themes after that warning?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) (Hesitates) No. I… I tried to be more careful. More subtle. But… I could not stop. It is… it was my way of expressing myself. My way of… resisting.

OFFICER: Can you describe another incident where you faced problems because of your art or your beliefs?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) In 2020… it was… around the time of the… the protests… the San Isidro Movement. I… I supported the movement. I shared information on social media. I even… I even created a sculpture… a small bust of… of one of the activists. The police… they started to watch me more closely. I noticed… unmarked cars… outside my house. I received… threatening phone calls. Anonymous… always anonymous.

OFFICER: What did the threatening phone calls say?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) They said… things like… "We know who you are." "We are watching you." "Stop what you are doing, or you will regret it." "You are a traitor to the Revolution."

OFFICER: Did you report these incidents to the police?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) (Scoffs) Report to the police? In Cuba? It would be… pointless. They are… part of the problem. They are the ones… doing the threatening.

OFFICER: I understand. Now, you mentioned the San Isidro Movement. Can you tell me more about your involvement and what happened to you as a result?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I… I was not a leader… or anything like that. But I… I supported them. I believed in their cause. I went to… some of the protests. I used my art to… to spread their message. After the protests… were shut down… the repression… it became much worse. Many people were arrested. Disappeared. I knew… it was only a matter of time before they came for me.

OFFICER: What specific event led you to finally leave Cuba?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) It was… in March of 2022. I was… walking home one evening. It was late. Two men… they stopped me on the street. They were… plainclothes. They did not identify themselves. They… they grabbed me. They forced me into a car. They drove me to… a deserted place… outside the city. They… they beat me. They… they told me to stop creating art. They told me to stop supporting the opposition. They said… next time… it would be worse.

OFFICER: Can you describe the beating in more detail? Where on your body were you hit? What did they use?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) They… they punched me in the face… in the stomach. They kicked me… in the legs. One of them… he had… a metal pipe. He hit me… on the back. I… I had… bruises… cuts. I… I could barely walk for days.

OFFICER: Did you seek medical treatment for your injuries?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) No. I was… afraid. If I went to the hospital… they would ask questions. I did not want to… attract more attention to myself. I treated myself… at home. With… with home remedies.

OFFICER: Do you have any photos or other evidence of these injuries?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) No. I… I did not take any photos. I just… wanted to forget it. To heal.

OFFICER: After this incident, what did you do?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I knew… I had to leave. I could not stay in Cuba any longer. I was… in danger. My life was… at risk. I… I sold everything I could. My apartment… my studio… my art supplies. I borrowed money from friends. I got a visa… a tourist visa… to Mexico.

OFFICER: And from Mexico, how did you enter the United States?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I… I crossed the border… in Texas. I… I presented myself to immigration officials… and asked for asylum.

OFFICER: Do you have any family members in Cuba?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes. My wife… Maria. She is… still in Cuba.

OFFICER: Is she aware of your asylum claim?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes. I… I speak to her on the phone… when I can. It is… difficult. The phone calls… they are monitored.

OFFICER: Do you believe your wife is in danger because of your actions and your asylum claim?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes. I am… very worried about her. The government… they know we are married. They know I have left the country. They may… retaliate against her.

OFFICER: Mr. Rodriguez, did you attempt to relocate to another part of Cuba to avoid the persecution you feared?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) No. There is… nowhere to go. The government… its reach is everywhere. It does not matter… where you live in Cuba. If they want to find you… they will find you. Also, my art… my reputation… it follows me. It is not something I can easily escape.

OFFICER: Why can’t you return to Cuba?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Because… they will arrest me. They will imprison me. They may… kill me. I have… spoken out against the government. I have… created art that criticizes them. They have… warned me. They have… beaten me. If I return… they will not give me another chance.

OFFICER: What evidence have you submitted in support of your asylum claim?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I submitted… copies of articles… about the San Isidro Movement. I submitted… photos of some of my sculptures. I submitted… a letter from a friend… an art critic… who knows about my situation. I wish I had more… but it is difficult to get evidence out of Cuba.

OFFICER: Can you tell me more about this letter from your friend? What does it say?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) It… it describes my art. It explains the… political themes in my work. It talks about… the repression I faced. It… it confirms that I am… a target of the Cuban government.

OFFICER: What are your plans if you are granted asylum in the United States?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I want to… to continue my art. To create sculptures. To… to express myself freely. I want to… to share my story… with others. I also want to… to bring my wife here… so we can be together. I believe… my skills… my artistic talent… can be of use here. I can… contribute to American society.

OFFICER: How do you plan to support yourself financially while you pursue your art?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I… I am willing to… to work. To do… any job. I know… it will be difficult at first. But I am… a hard worker. I am… determined to succeed. I also hope… eventually… to be able to sell my art. To exhibit in galleries. To… to make a living… doing what I love.

OFFICER: Your English is limited. How do you plan to improve your English language skills?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I am… taking classes. At a local community center. I am… also practicing… with friends. I know… it is important to learn English… if I want to… to integrate into American society.

OFFICER: Mr. Rodriguez, do you have any questions for me at this time?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes. I… I would like to know… how long… it will take… to process my application. And… if there is anything else… I can do… to help my case.

OFFICER: I understand your concern. I cannot give you a specific timeframe, as each case is different. However, we will process your application as efficiently as possible. If we need any further information from you, we will contact you. As for helping your case, ensure that you provide us with any new evidence or information that becomes available.

OFFICER: Thank you for your time, Mr. Rodriguez. That concludes our interview. We will notify you of our decision in writing.

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Thank you. Thank you very much.
