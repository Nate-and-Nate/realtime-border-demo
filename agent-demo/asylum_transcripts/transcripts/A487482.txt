INTERVIEW BEGINS

OFFICER: Good morning, Mr. Ramirez. My name is Officer Johnson, and I'm an asylum officer with USCIS. Thank you for coming in today. This is a defensive asylum interview, meaning you are seeking asylum as a defense against removal proceedings. I need to inform you that I am recording this interview. I will be asking you questions about your background and your reasons for seeking asylum in the United States. It is very important that you answer all my questions truthfully and completely. Do you understand?

APPLICANT: Yes, Officer. I understand.

OFFICER: Before we begin, I need to swear you in. Please raise your right hand and repeat after me: "I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God."

APPLICANT: I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God.

OFFICER: Thank you. Please state your full name and date of birth for the record.

APPLICANT: My full name is Ricardo Alberto Ramirez, and my date of birth is May 10, 1981.

OFFICER: Thank you. Mr. Ramirez, can you please tell me a little about your background, where you were born and raised, and something about your family.

APPLICANT: Yes, Officer. I was born and raised in El Salvador, in a small town near San Salvador called… called Santa Lucia. My family… it was just my mother and me. My father… he left when I was very young. My mother, she worked very hard to provide for us.

OFFICER: And what kind of work did your mother do?

APPLICANT: She cleaned houses. She worked long hours, but it was never enough money.

OFFICER: I see. And what about your education? You indicated on your application that you have no formal education. Is that correct?

APPLICANT: Yes, that is correct. I didn't go to school. I had to work to help my mother.

OFFICER: I understand. However, you also indicated that your professional background is in education. Can you explain this apparent discrepancy?

APPLICANT: (Hesitates) Yes, um… It's difficult to explain. I didn't go to a formal school, but I… I learned from my mother. She was very smart, even though she didn't have education either. And I… I taught people in my community.

OFFICER: What did you teach them?

APPLICANT: I… I helped them learn to read and write. Basic things. And sometimes, I would share stories… stories from the news, or things I heard on the radio.

OFFICER: So, you would consider yourself a… community educator?

APPLICANT: Yes, that's a good way to put it. A community educator.

OFFICER: Okay. Now, Mr. Ramirez, let’s move on to the reasons why you left El Salvador. You stated in your application that you fear persecution based on your political opinion. Can you tell me more about that?

APPLICANT: Yes. It started… it started with me talking about the government. I was… critical of the corruption. Of the way they were treating the people. I would talk to people in the town, share my opinions.

OFFICER: Can you give me a specific example of something you said or did that you believe led to the persecution you fear?

APPLICANT: Well, one time, I… I organized a small protest. It was just a few people, maybe ten or fifteen, but we marched in the town square, holding signs. We were protesting the… the high price of food.

OFFICER: When did this protest take place?

APPLICANT: (Thinks for a moment) It was… I think it was in… April of 2021.

OFFICER: And what happened at this protest?

APPLICANT: The police came. They told us to stop. We didn't stop, and they… they started pushing us around. One officer… he grabbed me and pushed me to the ground. He told me to shut my mouth, or I would regret it.

OFFICER: Did you file a complaint with the police about this incident?

APPLICANT: No. No, I didn't. What good would that do? They were the ones who attacked me.

OFFICER: Okay. You also mentioned that you cooperated with allied forces. Could you explain the nature of this cooperation?

APPLICANT: (Hesitates) Yes. When… when the American soldiers were in El Salvador… a long time ago… I… I helped them.

OFFICER: How did you help them? Can you be specific?

APPLICANT: I… I gave them information. About… about the guerrillas. Where they were hiding.

OFFICER: What kind of information did you have access to? You mentioned you are a community educator. How would you come across information about guerrilla hideouts?

APPLICANT: (Sweating slightly) I… I heard things. From people in the town. People trusted me. They knew I was against the violence.

OFFICER: And you passed this information directly to American soldiers?

APPLICANT: Yes.

OFFICER: Do you have any documentation to support this claim? Any letters, records, or anything else that would verify your cooperation with allied forces?

APPLICANT: No. I don't. It was all… secret. I couldn't tell anyone.

OFFICER: I understand. Now, after the protest in April 2021, did anything else happen that made you fear for your safety?

APPLICANT: Yes. A few weeks later… I started getting threats. People would call my house, late at night. They wouldn't say anything, just… breathing. And one time, I found a… a dead animal on my doorstep. A cat.

OFFICER: Did you report these threats to the police?

APPLICANT: No. I was too afraid. I knew they wouldn't help me.

OFFICER: Did you know who was making these threats?

APPLICANT: I suspected it was… people connected to the government. Or maybe… the gangs. They didn't like me talking about them either.

OFFICER: Did you consider moving to another part of El Salvador, to get away from these threats?

APPLICANT: Yes, I did. But where could I go? The whole country is dangerous. The gangs are everywhere. And the government… they are corrupt everywhere.

OFFICER: So, you believed there was nowhere safe for you in El Salvador?

APPLICANT: That's right.

OFFICER: When did you decide to leave El Salvador?

APPLICANT: It was… in May of 2022. After… after my mother died.

OFFICER: I’m sorry to hear about your mother. How did she pass away?

APPLICANT: She was… sick. For a long time. I couldn't afford to get her proper medical care.

OFFICER: After your mother passed, you decided to leave. Can you describe your journey to the United States?

APPLICANT: Yes. I… I traveled by bus. Through Guatemala and Mexico. It was very difficult. Very dangerous. I saw many bad things.

OFFICER: Can you give me some specific examples of the "bad things" you saw?

APPLICANT: (Looks down) I… I don't want to talk about it. It was… traumatic. People being robbed, beaten… I just want to forget it.

OFFICER: I understand, but it’s important for me to understand the circumstances of your journey. Can you tell me approximately how long the journey took?

APPLICANT: It took… about two months. Maybe a little longer.

OFFICER: And how did you enter the United States?

APPLICANT: I… I crossed the border illegally. Near… Tijuana.

OFFICER: When did you enter the United States?

APPLICANT: In… July of 2022.

OFFICER: And what are your plans if you are granted asylum in the United States?

APPLICANT: I want to… to work. To contribute to society. I want to use my skills to help people.

OFFICER: How do you plan to utilize your skills in education, given that you have no formal credentials?

APPLICANT: I… I can volunteer. I can teach people English. I can share my knowledge of… of El Salvadorian culture.

OFFICER: Do you have any family members in the United States?

APPLICANT: No. I am alone here.

OFFICER: Mr. Ramirez, I have a few more questions for you. You stated earlier that you organized a protest in April of 2021. However, in your written application, you stated that you became politically active after your mother's death in May of 2022. Can you explain this discrepancy?

APPLICANT: (Stammers) Um… I… I misspoke. The protest… it was… it was after my mother died. Yes, that's right. My memory… it's not so good.

OFFICER: So, you are now saying that the protest occurred after May 2022, not in April 2021 as you initially stated?

APPLICANT: Yes. That is correct.

OFFICER: Also, you mentioned cooperating with American soldiers a "long time ago." Could you please provide a more specific timeframe? The Salvadoran Civil War ended in 1992. How old were you at that time?

APPLICANT: (Visibly uncomfortable) I… I was… young. Very young. I don't remember exactly.

OFFICER: Mr. Ramirez, you stated your date of birth as May 10, 1981. That would make you approximately 11 years old when the Salvadoran Civil War ended. It seems unlikely that you would have been in a position to provide significant intelligence to American soldiers at that age. Can you explain this?

APPLICANT: (Silence)

OFFICER: Mr. Ramirez, it is important that you are truthful in your testimony.

APPLICANT: (Sighs) Look, Officer, I… I was trying to… to make my case stronger. I thought… I thought if I said I helped the Americans, it would… it would help me get asylum. But… but it's not true. I didn't help them. I was just a boy.

OFFICER: So, you admit that you fabricated that part of your story?

APPLICANT: Yes. I admit it.

OFFICER: Is there anything else in your testimony today that is not truthful?

APPLICANT: (Shakes head) No. Everything else is true. I swear.

OFFICER: Mr. Ramirez, I am concerned about the inconsistencies and the admission that you fabricated a significant portion of your testimony. Credibility is a crucial aspect of asylum claims.

APPLICANT: I understand, Officer. I am sorry.

OFFICER: Do you have any other evidence that you would like to present at this time?

APPLICANT: No. I don't.

OFFICER: Okay, Mr. Ramirez. I have no further questions for you at this time. Thank you for your cooperation. I will now review your application and your testimony. You will receive a written decision in the mail. Do you have any questions for me?

APPLICANT: No, Officer. Thank you.
