INTERVIEW BEGINS

OFFICER: Good morning, Mr. Ahmadi. My name is Officer Miller, and my employee number is AO-5589. I am an asylum officer with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Thank you for coming in today. As you know, you have applied for asylum in the United States. The purpose of this interview is to determine whether you meet the legal requirements for asylum. Before we begin, I need to place you under oath. Please raise your right hand and repeat after me: Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

APPLICANT: I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God.

OFFICER: Thank you. Let the record reflect that the applicant was sworn in. I understand you do not have legal representation today, is that correct?

APPLICANT: Yes, that is correct. I could not afford a lawyer.

OFFICER: Okay. I want to assure you that you have the right to seek legal counsel at any time. You may also ask for a break during this interview if you need one. Do you understand?

APPLICANT: Yes, I understand. Thank you.

OFFICER: Alright, Mr. Ahmadi, let's start with some background information. Can you please state your full name and date of birth for the record?

APPLICANT: My full name is Farid Ahmadi, and my date of birth is July 12, 1994.

OFFICER: And your current address in the United States?

APPLICANT: 123 Maple Street, Apartment 2B, Anytown, USA.

OFFICER: Thank you. Can you tell me about your family? You indicated on your application that you have one dependent family member. Who is that?

APPLICANT: Yes, that is my mother, Fatima Ahmadi. She is back in Afghanistan.

OFFICER: Okay. We’ll discuss your mother later. Let’s start with your life in Afghanistan. Where were you born and raised?

APPLICANT: I was born and raised in Kabul.

OFFICER: Could you describe your educational background? I see you have a Master's degree.

APPLICANT: Yes, I do. I completed my Bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering at Kabul University in 2016. Then, in 2018, I obtained my Master's degree in Construction Management, also from Kabul University.

OFFICER: That's impressive. What kind of work did you do after graduating?

APPLICANT: After my bachelor's, I worked as a junior engineer for a small construction company in Kabul. After my master's, I worked as a project manager for a larger company, mostly on residential building projects.

OFFICER: Can you provide the names of these companies and the dates you worked there?

APPLICANT: Sure. After my bachelor's degree, I worked for "Aryan Construction" from 2016 to 2018. After my master's, I worked for "Balkh Builders" from 2018 until I left Afghanistan in... uh... early 2022.

OFFICER: Early 2022. You left Afghanistan in early 2022. Your I-589 form states you left in June of 2022. Can you explain the discrepancy?

APPLICANT: (Hesitates) Uh... Yes, of course. What I meant was, I started *planning* to leave in early 2022. The actual departure was in June, yes. I apologize for the confusion.

OFFICER: Okay. Let's move on. You're claiming asylum based on your membership in a particular social group. Can you describe this group and why you fear persecution because of it?

APPLICANT: Yes. I fear persecution because I am considered… well, I am part of a group of educated, modern-thinking individuals who support women's rights and equality. We believe in a secular government and oppose the Taliban's ideology.

OFFICER: How is that a group? What makes you a member?

APPLICANT: It's... it's a group of people who share similar values and beliefs. We discuss these ideas openly. We… we met sometimes at cafes and talked.

OFFICER: Can you give me some examples of the conversations you had at these cafes? And how frequently did these meetings occur?

APPLICANT: We talked about… the future of Afghanistan, about the need for education, especially for girls. We met… irregularly. Maybe once a month, sometimes less. It depended on everyone's schedules.

OFFICER: Did you organize these meetings? Were you a leader in this group?

APPLICANT: No, no, I was not a leader. Just… a participant.

OFFICER: Your application mentions an incident where you were threatened. Can you describe that incident in detail, including the date, location, and who threatened you?

APPLICANT: Yes. This happened in March 2022, in Kabul. I was walking home from work when two men stopped me. They were… they looked like Taliban supporters. They had beards and were wearing traditional clothing. They started yelling at me, calling me a "Westernized infidel" and accusing me of spreading "corrupt ideas." They said I should be ashamed of supporting women's rights.

OFFICER: Did they identify themselves as Taliban?

APPLICANT: No, not directly. But it was clear they supported them. Their language, their appearance… it was obvious.

OFFICER: Did they physically harm you?

APPLICANT: No, not physically. They just threatened me. They said if they saw me again, I would regret it. They said they knew where I lived and worked.

OFFICER: Did you report this incident to the police?

APPLICANT: No. The police… they are not reliable. Many of them sympathize with the Taliban, or at least they are afraid of them. Reporting it would have made things worse.

OFFICER: Why do you say that? Have you had previous negative experiences with the police?

APPLICANT: (Hesitates) No, not personally. But I have heard stories… from friends and neighbors.

OFFICER: Can you provide specific examples of these stories?

APPLICANT: (Stammers) Uh… well, I heard that some police officers were turning a blind eye to Taliban activities, or even actively helping them. It was… common knowledge.

OFFICER: Let's go back to your work. As a project manager for Balkh Builders, what specific projects were you working on in the months leading up to your departure?

APPLICANT: I was working on a… a large apartment complex in the north of Kabul. It was a… a multi-story building with many units.

OFFICER: Do you have any documentation relating to your employment, such as pay stubs or a letter from your employer?

APPLICANT: I did, but… I didn't bring them. I was afraid they would be confiscated at the airport. I can try to get them sent to me.

OFFICER: That would be helpful. Now, you mentioned your mother is still in Afghanistan. Is she also at risk?

APPLICANT: Yes, definitely. She is… she is old and vulnerable. She depends on me. And because I left, the Taliban might target her to pressure me to return.

OFFICER: Has she been threatened or harassed since you left?

APPLICANT: (Looks down) I... I don't know for sure. I haven't been able to contact her directly. My cousin, who lives near her, told me that the Taliban have been asking about me in the neighborhood.

OFFICER: When was the last time you spoke with your cousin?

APPLICANT: About a month ago.

OFFICER: And how did you travel to the United States? Can you describe your route and the timeline?

APPLICANT: I flew from Kabul to Dubai, then from Dubai to… to Mexico City. From there, I traveled by bus to the U.S. border and crossed… I crossed illegally.

OFFICER: How long did the entire journey take?

APPLICANT: It took… about two weeks.

OFFICER: You applied for a U.S. tourist visa in 2019 and were denied. Why did you not disclose this on your I-589 form?

APPLICANT: (Visibly nervous) I… I forgot. It was a long time ago. I didn't think it was relevant.

OFFICER: It is highly relevant, Mr. Ahmadi. Failing to disclose information can negatively impact your credibility.

APPLICANT: I understand. I apologize. I truly forgot. I was young then, and I just wanted to see America. I didn't have any intention of staying.

OFFICER: If granted asylum, what are your plans for the future in the United States?

APPLICANT: I want to rebuild my life here. I want to use my education and skills to contribute to society. I hope to find a job in construction management, maybe even start my own company one day.

OFFICER: That's ambitious. Have you started looking for jobs?

APPLICANT: I have looked online a little bit, but without work authorization, it is difficult.

OFFICER: I see. Mr. Ahmadi, you mentioned you have a Master's degree in Construction Management. How were you able to afford this, given that you were working as a junior engineer?

APPLICANT: My family helped me. My father had some savings.

OFFICER: What did your father do for a living?

APPLICANT: He was a… a shopkeeper. He owned a small grocery store.

OFFICER: Okay. Now, you stated that you were threatened in March 2022. Why did you wait until June to leave? And if you were in so much danger, why travel to Dubai, and then Mexico, instead of seeking refuge in a safer location closer to Afghanistan?

APPLICANT: It took time to arrange everything. To get the money, to get the travel documents… It was not easy. As for why not a closer country… I believed the opportunity to get to the US, and eventually bring my mother here, was a better long-term solution. I know it sounds strange, but I really believed that.

OFFICER: Mr. Ahmadi, I have some concerns regarding the consistency and credibility of your testimony. Your explanation for the discrepancy in your departure date, your failure to disclose the previous visa denial, and the lack of corroborating evidence for your claims raise doubts about the genuineness of your fear of persecution. Your description of the "group" seems vague and undefined. Also, traveling to the US through Mexico adds to my doubts, considering safer options were available.

APPLICANT: (Pleadingly) But I am telling the truth! I am afraid to go back. My life is in danger!

OFFICER: I understand your concerns, Mr. Ahmadi. We will carefully review your application and the information provided during this interview. Do you have any other information you would like to add at this time?

APPLICANT: No, I think I have said everything. I just hope you believe me.

OFFICER: Thank you for your time, Mr. Ahmadi. This interview is now concluded. We will notify you of our decision in writing.
