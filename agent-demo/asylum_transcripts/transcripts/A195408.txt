INTERVIEW BEGINS

OFFICER: Good morning, Mr. Vargas. My name is Officer Miller, and this is an interview to determine your eligibility for asylum in the United States. With me is your attorney, Ms. Rodriguez.

APPLICANT: Good morning, Officer. Yes, Ms. Rodriguez is here.

OFFICER: Ms. Rodriguez, please state your name and bar number for the record.

ATTORNEY: Maria Rodriguez, Bar number 123456.

OFFICER: Thank you. Mr. Vargas, I need to swear you in before we begin. Please raise your right hand and repeat after me: Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

APPLICANT: I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God.

OFFICER: Thank you. Please be seated. I have reviewed your application, Form I-589, Application for Asylum and for Withholding of Removal, and the supporting documents you submitted. Today, I will ask you questions to clarify the information you provided and to assess your claim for asylum. Do you understand?

APPLICANT: Yes, Officer, I understand.

OFFICER: Let’s start with some background information. Can you please state your full name and date of birth for the record?

APPLICANT: My full name is Ricardo Vargas Lopez, and my date of birth is October 12, 1982.

OFFICER: And can you confirm your nationality?

APPLICANT: I am Cuban.

OFFICER: Now, you indicated on your application that you fear returning to Cuba due to gender-based violence. Can you elaborate on the specific reasons for your fear?

APPLICANT: Yes, Officer. In Cuba, being perceived as different, as not conforming to the strict masculine norms, carries a heavy price. I… I am not gay, per se, but I am… or was… a dancer. I enjoyed expressing myself through dance and, well, I was considered effeminate. This made me a target.

OFFICER: Can you tell me more about the social norms in Cuba regarding masculinity and how your behavior deviated from those norms?

APPLICANT: In Cuba, machismo is very strong. Men are expected to be strong, dominant, and not show any… softness, you understand? Dancing, especially the type of dancing I did – more expressive, artistic – was seen as… unmanly. People would whisper, make jokes, and worse.

OFFICER: What kind of dancing did you do?

APPLICANT: A mix, mostly. Modern dance, some ballet, even Afro-Cuban styles, but with a more expressive, contemporary approach. I performed in small theaters and community centers, mostly.

OFFICER: You mentioned “worse” than jokes and whispers. Can you please elaborate on the specific incidents of harassment or violence you experienced?

APPLICANT: It started small, with insults and name-calling. But it escalated. In 2018, I was walking home from a rehearsal one night when a group of men cornered me. They called me names, pushed me around, and told me to stop “acting like a *pato*.” They physically assaulted me, Officer. They punched me in the face and kicked me while I was on the ground.

OFFICER: Do you know who these men were?

APPLICANT: No, I didn’t recognize them. They were just… young men from the neighborhood. I think they were trying to… teach me a lesson.

OFFICER: Did you report this incident to the police?

APPLICANT: No, Officer. I was too afraid. The police in Cuba… they are not there to protect people like me. I feared that if I reported it, they would do nothing, or even worse, side with the attackers.

OFFICER: Why would they side with the attackers?

APPLICANT: Because they share the same prejudices. They see someone like me as… as an embarrassment to the revolution. They believe in traditional gender roles. Reporting it would have brought more attention to me, and more trouble.

OFFICER: Can you provide any specific examples of the police acting in a discriminatory manner toward individuals perceived as not conforming to gender norms?

APPLICANT: It's not always overt, but everyone knows it. There are whispers, stories… My friend, Marco, who is openly gay, was detained for "public indecency" for simply holding his boyfriend's hand in the park. He was harassed and humiliated by the police. He didn't even do anything! Everyone knows that the police will not protect you if you are different.

ATTORNEY: Officer, if I may add, reports from human rights organizations like Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International document the discrimination and harassment faced by LGBTQ+ individuals and those perceived as not conforming to gender norms in Cuba.

OFFICER: Thank you, Ms. Rodriguez. Mr. Vargas, you mentioned the attack in 2018. Did you experience any other incidents of violence or harassment after that?

APPLICANT: Yes, Officer. The harassment continued. I received threatening messages on social media. People would shout insults at me in the street. And then, in early 2022, it happened again.

OFFICER: What happened in 2022?

APPLICANT: I was attacked again, this time even worse. I was walking to the market when two men jumped me. They beat me badly, Officer. They used a metal pipe. I was hospitalized.

OFFICER: Do you have any medical records from that hospitalization?

APPLICANT: Yes, I included them with my application. They are in Spanish, but Ms. Rodriguez has provided a certified translation.

OFFICER: (Reviews the documents briefly) Thank you. The records indicate you sustained significant injuries, including a fractured arm and head trauma. Did you report this incident to the police?

APPLICANT: No, Officer. After the first attack, I knew it was pointless. Plus, this time, one of the men… I recognized him. He was a member of the local Committee for the Defense of the Revolution (CDR).

OFFICER: A CDR member? And you believe that’s why you were attacked?

APPLICANT: Absolutely. The CDRs are the eyes and ears of the government. They monitor everything that goes on in the neighborhood. They enforce conformity. I believe they targeted me because I was seen as a dissident, someone who didn't fit in, someone who was… a threat to their idea of a proper Cuban citizen.

OFFICER: You stated you have a primary education. Can you elaborate on your educational background?

APPLICANT: Yes, I completed primary school, but due to family circumstances, I couldn't continue my education. My family needed me to work.

OFFICER: What kind of work did you do to support your family?

APPLICANT: Mostly informal jobs. I helped my mother sell produce at the market. Later, I learned some basic accounting and worked as a bookkeeper for a small private business.

OFFICER: Your application mentions experience in business and finance. Can you describe your professional skills and experiences in more detail?

APPLICANT: After working as a bookkeeper, I started my own small business. I bought and sold goods, mostly clothing and household items. It was a small operation, but I managed to make a living. I learned a lot about managing money, negotiating prices, and dealing with customers.

OFFICER: How might those skills translate to employment opportunities in the United States?

APPLICANT: I believe I could work in retail, or perhaps in a small business. I am a hard worker, and I am willing to learn new skills. I am also very good with numbers, so I could potentially work in accounting or bookkeeping again. I am eager to contribute to this country.

OFFICER: You mentioned attempting to relocate within Cuba. Where did you try to go, and why did it not work out?

APPLICANT: After the second attack, I realized I had to leave Havana. I tried to move to Santiago de Cuba, to stay with my aunt. But it was difficult. Housing is scarce, and my aunt's apartment was very small. More importantly, the same prejudices exist there. People still judge you for being different. I realized that even if I moved to another city, I would still be at risk. The problem wasn't just the neighborhood; it was the entire system.

OFFICER: Why do you believe you cannot return to Cuba now?

APPLICANT: Because the people who attacked me are still there. The CDR is still watching. The police will not protect me. If I return, I am certain they will target me again. I fear for my life, Officer.

OFFICER: Are any members of your family still in Cuba?

APPLICANT: Yes, my mother is still there. She is elderly and relies on me for support.

OFFICER: Is she at risk because of your asylum claim?

APPLICANT: I worry about her, Officer. The Cuban government is known to retaliate against family members of those who are seen as dissidents. I try to stay in contact with her, but I am careful about what I say. I fear that if they know I am speaking out against the government, they will harass her.

ATTORNEY: Officer, we have included affidavits from human rights experts who can testify to the Cuban government's practice of targeting family members of those seeking asylum abroad.

OFFICER: Thank you, Ms. Rodriguez. Mr. Vargas, can you describe your journey to the United States?

APPLICANT: I flew from Havana to Cancun, Mexico. From there, I traveled by bus to the US-Mexico border. I crossed the border and presented myself to immigration officials, requesting asylum.

OFFICER: Did you have a visa to enter Mexico?

APPLICANT: Yes, I obtained a tourist visa.

OFFICER: Finally, Mr. Vargas, what are your plans if you are granted asylum in the United States?

APPLICANT: I want to work hard, learn new skills, and contribute to this country. I want to find a job where I can use my business experience. I also want to continue to pursue my passion for dance, perhaps by taking classes or joining a community group. Most importantly, I want to live in a place where I can be safe and free from fear. I want to build a new life.

OFFICER: (Pauses, reviewing the file and notes). Mr. Vargas, your testimony has been detailed and consistent with the information provided in your application. I have also considered the supporting documents you submitted, including the medical records and the affidavits from human rights experts. I have a few follow-up questions. You mentioned receiving threatening messages on social media. Do you have any copies of those messages?

APPLICANT: Yes, Officer. I took screenshots of some of them before I left Cuba. They are included in the additional evidence Ms. Rodriguez submitted.

OFFICER: (Reviews the additional evidence). I see. These messages contain explicit threats and homophobic slurs. Another question: You stated that one of the men who attacked you was a member of the CDR. How certain are you of this identification?

APPLICANT: I am certain, Officer. I had seen him around the neighborhood many times. He was always watching, always reporting on people. I recognized his face immediately.

OFFICER: Okay. And finally, you mentioned that you are supporting your mother financially. How were you sending her money from Cuba, and how do you plan to support her from the United States?

APPLICANT: In Cuba, I used informal channels to send her money. It was risky, but it was the only way. Here, I plan to work hard and send her remittances through a legal money transfer service. I know it won't be easy, but I am determined to provide for her.

OFFICER: Ms. Rodriguez, do you have any additional comments or information you would like to add on behalf of your client?

ATTORNEY: Yes, Officer. I would like to reiterate that Mr. Vargas's fear of persecution is well-founded. He has credibly demonstrated that he was targeted because of his perceived deviation from societal gender norms, and that the Cuban authorities are unwilling or unable to protect him. His case aligns with established asylum jurisprudence regarding gender-based violence and persecution. Furthermore, the supporting documentation, including the medical records, threatening messages, and expert affidavits, provides substantial corroboration for his claims. We believe that Mr. Vargas has met his burden of proof and is eligible for asylum in the United States.

OFFICER: Thank you, Ms. Rodriguez. Mr. Vargas, do you have anything else you would like to add?

APPLICANT: Only that I am truly afraid to return to Cuba. I am seeking a safe place to live and to contribute to society. I hope you will consider my case favorably.

OFFICER: Thank you, Mr. Vargas. That concludes our interview. We will notify you of our decision in writing.

APPLICANT: Thank you, Officer.

ATTORNEY: Thank you, Officer.
