OFFICER: Good morning. My name is Officer Miller, and I am an asylum officer with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.

Do you understand?

OFFICER: What kind of work did you do after you left school?

OFFICER: So, nothing consistent. And you indicated on your application that you are currently unemployed. Is that still the case?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Si, todavía no tengo trabajo.

OFFICER: You mentioned your family. Are your mother and grandmother still in Cuba?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Si.

OFFICER: Are they also at risk because of your LGBTQ+ identity?
