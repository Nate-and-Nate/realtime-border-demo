INTERVIEW BEGINS

OFFICER: Good morning. My name is Officer Miller, and I am an Asylum Officer with USCIS. This is a defensive asylum interview, meaning you are seeking asylum as a defense against deportation. Before we begin, I need to inform you of your rights. You have the right to be represented by an attorney, and I see that Ms. Chen is present. You have the right to present evidence on your behalf, and the right to be questioned in English or through an interpreter. Do you understand these rights?

APPLICANT: Yes, I understand.

OFFICER: Ms. Chen, could you please state your name and bar number for the record?

ATTORNEY: Sarah Chen, Bar Number 123456.

OFFICER: Thank you. I need to place you under oath. Please raise your right hand and repeat after me: "I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God."

APPLICANT: I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God.

OFFICER: Thank you. Please be seated. I have reviewed your application, Form I-589, Application for Asylum and Withholding of Removal, and the supporting documentation you have submitted. We are here today to discuss the information you provided and to give you an opportunity to elaborate on your claims. Can you confirm your name and date of birth for the record?

APPLICANT: My name is Li Wei, and my date of birth is October 26, 1986.

OFFICER: Thank you. Your application indicates you are from China and that you fear persecution based on your religion. Is that correct?

APPLICANT: Yes, that is correct.

OFFICER: Let's start with your background. Can you tell me about your life in China, including where you lived and what you did for work?

APPLICANT: I lived in a small village near Chengdu, in Sichuan province. It’s… it's a very rural area. My family are farmers, mostly. I didn’t… I didn't do well in school. I only finished primary school. After that, I helped my family with the farm. But I didn't like farm work much. So, when I was old enough, around 18, I moved to Chengdu to find work. I worked in restaurants, mostly. Washing dishes, serving tables, cleaning. Anything I could find.

OFFICER: Can you describe the kind of primary school you attended? What was the curriculum like?

APPLICANT: It was... a very basic school. Just one small building for the whole village. We learned reading, writing, some math, and… and a lot of political stuff. You know, about the Communist Party and Chairman Mao.

OFFICER: You mentioned working in restaurants. How long did you work in the service industry?

APPLICANT: Almost my whole adult life. I started as a dishwasher, then a server, and eventually I worked my way up to assistant manager in a small hotpot restaurant. I worked there for about five years before I left China.

OFFICER: Now, let's talk about your religion. What is your religion, and how long have you been practicing it?

APPLICANT: I am a Christian. I became a Christian about ten years ago.

OFFICER: How did you become a Christian?

APPLICANT: A friend introduced me. I was… I was feeling lost and confused about my life. She invited me to a house church. I went, and I felt… I felt like I belonged. Like I had found something real. The people were kind, and the teachings… they made sense to me.

OFFICER: Can you describe the specific practices of your faith?

APPLICANT: We met in secret, in different people's homes. We would sing hymns, read from the Bible, and the pastor would give a sermon. We also helped each other out, you know, with money, with food, with support. It was a community. We tried to keep everything very quiet, very discreet.

OFFICER: Why was it necessary to meet in secret?

APPLICANT: Because the government… the government doesn’t like unofficial churches. They only allow churches that are registered with the government and controlled by them. We didn't want to be controlled. We wanted to worship freely.

OFFICER: Can you describe any specific incidents that led you to fear persecution?

APPLICANT: Yes. It started slowly. At first, it was just… whispers. People at work making jokes about my “strange” friends. Then, one day, about three years ago, the police raided the house where we were holding a service. It was… terrifying.

OFFICER: Can you provide the date and location of this raid?

APPLICANT: It was… I think it was June 15, 2019. It was in Chengdu, in the apartment of… of Sister Li.

OFFICER: What happened during the raid?

APPLICANT: The police burst in. They were shouting. They pushed people around. They confiscated our Bibles and our hymn books. They arrested the pastor and several other members of the church, including me.

OFFICER: What happened after you were arrested?

APPLICANT: They took us to the police station. They interrogated us for hours. They wanted to know who the other members of the church were, where we got our money, who was in charge. They threatened us. They said we were engaging in illegal religious activities and that we could be imprisoned.

OFFICER: Ms. Chen, would you like to add anything at this point?

ATTORNEY: Officer, I would like to note for the record that China has a well-documented history of persecuting unregistered religious groups, particularly Christians.

OFFICER: Thank you, Ms. Chen. Mr. Li, how long were you detained?

APPLICANT: I was detained for three days. They released me after I signed a statement saying I would no longer participate in the church.

OFFICER: Did you stop attending the church after that?

APPLICANT: No. I was scared, but I couldn't abandon my faith. I continued to meet with the church in secret, but we were much more careful.

OFFICER: Did you experience any further problems after that incident?

APPLICANT: Yes. The police started monitoring me. I noticed them following me. They would ask my neighbors about me. My boss at the restaurant started treating me differently. He said he was worried about having someone like me working for him. Eventually, he fired me.

OFFICER: When were you fired from your job?

APPLICANT: It was about six months after the raid, so… around December 2019.

OFFICER: What did you do after you lost your job?

APPLICANT: I tried to find other work, but it was difficult. I think my name was on some kind of list. No one wanted to hire me. I had to rely on my friends from the church for support.

OFFICER: Did you report these incidents to the police or any other authorities?

APPLICANT: No. What would be the point? The police were the ones persecuting me. Who would I report them to?

OFFICER: You mentioned you are also a human rights activist. Can you elaborate on that?

APPLICANT: Yes. Because of my faith, I became more aware of injustice in China. I started to speak out about it, mostly online. I used social media to share information about human rights abuses, religious persecution, and government corruption. I also participated in some small protests.

OFFICER: Can you provide specific examples of the protests you participated in?

APPLICANT: There was one protest against the demolition of a church in a nearby town. I went with some friends from my church. We held signs and chanted slogans. It was peaceful, but the police came and dispersed us. They arrested several people. I managed to escape.

OFFICER: When did this protest occur?

APPLICANT: It was… I think it was in early 2020. Maybe February or March.

OFFICER: Did your activism lead to any further problems with the authorities?

APPLICANT: Yes. The online posts got me into trouble. I received threats. People would leave messages on my social media accounts, saying things like, "We know who you are," and "You will pay for this." One time, I was followed home by a group of men. I was scared.

OFFICER: Can you describe the men who followed you?

APPLICANT: They were… they were wearing plain clothes. They looked like… thugs. They didn't say anything, but they stared at me. They followed me for several blocks. I was terrified.

OFFICER: What made you decide to leave China?

APPLICANT: After being fired, constantly harassed, and followed, I realized it was no longer safe for me. I was afraid I would be arrested again, or worse. I feared for my life. I couldn’t live freely or practice my faith.

OFFICER: Did you consider relocating to another part of China?

APPLICANT: Yes, I did. But I didn't think it would make a difference. The government is everywhere. They have informants everywhere. I knew they would find me eventually. And my family… if I stayed, they would be at risk too.

OFFICER: Can you describe your family situation?

APPLICANT: I have my parents and one brother. They still live in the village near Chengdu.

OFFICER: Are they also Christians?

APPLICANT: No, they are not. They are… they are traditionalists. They respect my beliefs, but they don't share them.

OFFICER: Do you believe they are at risk because of your actions?

APPLICANT: Yes, I do. If I am deported back to China, the government will definitely target them. They will be questioned, harassed, maybe even arrested. I don't want to put them in danger.

OFFICER: How did you leave China, and what was your journey to the United States?

APPLICANT: I left China on a tourist visa. I flew to Mexico City, then traveled overland to the United States border. I crossed the border illegally near Tijuana.

OFFICER: When did you enter the United States?

APPLICANT: I entered the United States on March 10, 2021.

OFFICER: What are your plans if you are granted asylum in the United States?

APPLICANT: I want to work. I want to contribute to society. I have experience in the restaurant industry. I hope to find a job in a restaurant, maybe as a manager. I also want to continue to practice my faith freely and to speak out against injustice.

OFFICER: Do you have any documentation to support your claims?

APPLICANT: Yes. I have submitted copies of news articles about the persecution of Christians in China. I have also submitted screenshots of the threats I received on social media. And letters from friends who can attest to what happened to me.

OFFICER: I have reviewed the documentation you submitted. Do you have any additional evidence to present at this time?

APPLICANT: No, I think I have submitted everything.

OFFICER: You mentioned only having primary school education. How did you learn to speak English so well?

APPLICANT: (Hesitates) I… I studied hard. I used online resources. I practiced with friends. I knew I needed to learn English if I wanted to leave China and start a new life. Also, in the restaurant, I worked with foreigners, so I practiced with them.

OFFICER: What are your thoughts on the Chinese government's policy on religious freedom?

APPLICANT: It's… it's a sham. They claim to protect religious freedom, but in reality, they only allow religions that are controlled by the state. They persecute anyone who deviates from the official line.

OFFICER: Officer, I would like to add that my client's advanced English proficiency, despite limited formal education, speaks to his resourcefulness and determination, qualities that will undoubtedly benefit him as he integrates into American society.

OFFICER: Thank you, Ms. Chen. Mr. Li, is there anything else you would like to add before we conclude this interview?

APPLICANT: Yes. I just want to say that I am terrified of returning to China. I believe I will be persecuted if I am forced to go back. I just want to live in peace and practice my faith freely. I want a chance to build a new life here in the United States.

OFFICER: Thank you, Mr. Li. Ms. Chen, do you have any final comments?

ATTORNEY: No, Officer, I believe my client has clearly articulated his well-founded fear of persecution. We appreciate your time and consideration.

OFFICER: Thank you both. This interview is now concluded. We will notify you of our decision in writing.
