INTERVIEW BEGINS

OFFICER: Good morning, Mr. Garcia. My name is Officer Miller, and I'm an asylum officer with USCIS. Thank you for coming in today. As you know, you have applied for asylum in the United States. This interview is a crucial part of the process. I want to assure you that everything you say here will be kept confidential. I need to inform you that you are not required to answer any question you don’t want to, but understand that not answering questions may affect your case. Do you understand?

APPLICANT: Yes, Officer, I understand.

OFFICER: Before we begin, I need to swear you in. Please raise your right hand and repeat after me: Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

APPLICANT: I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God.

OFFICER: Thank you. Please be seated. I've reviewed your application, Form I-589, and the supporting documents you submitted. Today, I will ask you questions to clarify the information you provided and to gather more details about your claim. We will discuss your background, your experiences in Cuba, and your reasons for seeking asylum here in the United States. Are you ready to proceed?

APPLICANT: Yes, Officer. I am ready.

OFFICER: Let’s start with some background information. Can you please state your full name and date of birth for the record?

APPLICANT: My full name is Alejandro Garcia Rodriguez, and my date of birth is March 12, 1972.

OFFICER: And where were you born?

APPLICANT: Havana, Cuba.

OFFICER: What is your highest level of education?

APPLICANT: I completed secondary education. That's… high school, I believe you call it here.

OFFICER: What kind of school was it? Was it a general education, or did you specialize in a particular subject?

APPLICANT: It was a general education. The standard curriculum. After secondary school, I started teacher training, but I didn't complete the full certification.

OFFICER: You stated on your application that you worked as a teacher. Can you tell me more about that? Where did you teach? What subjects? For how long?

APPLICANT: Yes, I worked as a teacher. Well, I was a teaching assistant, really. At a primary school in Havana, Escuela Primaria José Martí. I helped the main teacher with lessons, grading papers, you know, the usual tasks. I did that for about five years, off and on.

OFFICER: "Off and on?" Can you explain that?

APPLICANT: Yes, sorry. It wasn’t always a formal position. Sometimes, I was just helping out when they were short-staffed. Other times, I had a more permanent role. The school was always underfunded, so they couldn't always afford to pay me a full salary.

OFFICER: So, you weren’t always formally employed as a teaching assistant. Were you employed elsewhere during those "off" periods?

APPLICANT: I did odd jobs. Some construction work, helping friends with their businesses… nothing consistent.

OFFICER: Okay. Let's move on to the reasons you left Cuba. Your application states that you fear persecution because you are a gay man. Can you describe the specific incidents that led you to fear for your safety in Cuba?

APPLICANT: It was… a buildup of things. The general atmosphere of discrimination. The way people would look at me, make comments. It wasn't always physical, but the threat was always there.

OFFICER: Can you give me some specific examples of these comments or instances of discrimination? Dates, locations, who was involved?

APPLICANT: Well, there was this one time… I was walking down the street with a friend, another man. And some people started shouting things at us. Homophobic slurs. They followed us for a while, yelling. It was very frightening. This was… maybe two years ago? On Calle Obispo, in Havana. I don't remember exactly who they were, just some men in the street.

OFFICER: You don’t remember the exact date or any identifying features of the men?

APPLICANT: No, it happened quickly. I was too scared to pay attention to details.

OFFICER: You mentioned that this was a "buildup of things." Can you describe other incidents?

APPLICANT: There were other times when people made comments, or when I felt… unsafe. Once, someone threw a rock at my window. I don't know for sure it was because I'm gay, but… it felt that way.

OFFICER: When did this happen?

APPLICANT: About a year before I left.

OFFICER: Did you report any of these incidents to the police?

APPLICANT: No. What would be the point? The police don’t care about gay people in Cuba. They would probably just laugh.

OFFICER: You stated in your application that you were verbally harassed by your neighbor. Can you explain that situation?

APPLICANT: Ah, yes. My neighbor, Hector. He was always making comments. Calling me names. Saying I was an abomination. He would do this regularly, whenever he saw me.

OFFICER: How often was "regularly"? And can you provide specific examples of what he said?

APPLICANT: Maybe… two or three times a week? He would call me “maricón,” “pájaro.” Things like that. He would also make threats, saying I should leave the neighborhood or something bad would happen.

OFFICER: Did he ever physically harm you?

APPLICANT: No, not physically. But the threats… they were very real.

OFFICER: Did you ever try to move to another part of Havana, or another city, to avoid this harassment?

APPLICANT: No, I didn’t have the resources. Moving in Cuba is difficult. You need permission, and money… I didn’t have either. Besides, I feared it was the same everywhere.

OFFICER: In your application, you mentioned attending a gay pride event in Havana. Can you describe what happened there?

APPLICANT: Yes, I went to the… well, it wasn't officially a Pride parade. It was more of a gathering, a demonstration. The police came and broke it up. They arrested people.

OFFICER: Were you arrested?

APPLICANT: No, I managed to get away. But I saw people being beaten and dragged into police cars. It was terrifying.

OFFICER: Can you give me the date of this event?

APPLICANT: I think it was… May of last year? 2023.

OFFICER: According to news reports and government statements, in May 2023, the Cuban government allowed an officially sanctioned LGBTQ+ event. Are you referring to a different event?

APPLICANT: Maybe… Maybe I’m mistaken about the date. It was a long time ago, and I was very scared.

OFFICER: You said you were a teaching assistant. Did your colleagues or supervisors know you were gay? Did they ever discriminate against you?

APPLICANT: I tried to keep it a secret. But I think some people suspected. There were some… awkward silences, sometimes. I wasn’t invited to social events with the other teachers.

OFFICER: Did you ever face any professional repercussions because of your sexual orientation? Were you denied promotions or opportunities?

APPLICANT: No, not directly. But I always felt… held back. I knew I would never be able to advance in my career because of who I am.

OFFICER: You entered the United States on a tourist visa. Is that correct?

APPLICANT: Yes, that is correct.

OFFICER: Did you tell the U.S. consular officer during your visa interview that you were planning to seek asylum here?

APPLICANT: No, of course not. They would never have given me the visa.

OFFICER: So, you misrepresented your intentions when you applied for the visa.

APPLICANT: I wouldn't say "misrepresented." I just… didn't tell them everything. I needed to escape.

OFFICER: What do you plan to do if you are granted asylum here in the United States?

APPLICANT: I want to work. I want to contribute to society. I could teach Spanish. Or maybe work with children. I have experience. I want to build a new life here, where I can be myself without fear.

OFFICER: Have you considered what you would do if you are not granted asylum?

APPLICANT: I… I don't know. I can't go back to Cuba. It's not safe for me there.

OFFICER: Do you have any family members in Cuba who might be at risk if you are granted asylum here?

APPLICANT: No, I live alone. My parents are deceased, and I don't have any siblings.

OFFICER: You mentioned earlier that you had a male friend in Cuba. Is he also at risk?

APPLICANT: I don't know. I haven't been in contact with him since I left. I hope he's okay.

OFFICER: Do you have any evidence to support your claim, such as photos, letters, or medical records?

APPLICANT: I don’t have much, I was afraid to keep any records about my identity. I have some photos of the LGBTQ+ gathering I attended, but I don’t know if they will help. I submitted them with my application.

OFFICER: I have reviewed those photos. It's difficult to discern much from them. They show a crowd of people, but there's no clear indication of police activity or arrests. You mentioned earlier that the police broke it up.

APPLICANT: It was chaotic. People were running everywhere. It was difficult to get a clear picture.

OFFICER: Mr. Garcia, you stated that you were a teaching assistant at Escuela Primaria José Martí for five years. Can you provide any documentation to verify your employment, such as pay stubs or letters from the school?

APPLICANT: I don't have any pay stubs. As I said, sometimes I was paid, sometimes I wasn't. And I don't have any letters. I didn't think to get them before I left. It's difficult to get official documents like that in Cuba, you know?

OFFICER: I understand. However, the lack of documentation makes it difficult to verify your claims. Also, I noticed a discrepancy in your application. On one page, you stated that you left Cuba in June of 2023, but on another, you said you left in August of 2023. Can you clarify which date is correct?

APPLICANT: (Hesitates) It was… August. Yes, August. I must have made a mistake on the application.

OFFICER: Why did you hesitate?

APPLICANT: I was just… nervous. It's a stressful situation.

OFFICER: Okay. Is there anything else you would like to add, anything you think is important for me to know?

APPLICANT: I just want to be safe. I want to live a normal life, without fear. I hope you can understand that.

OFFICER: Thank you, Mr. Garcia. I have no further questions for you at this time. We will notify you of our decision in writing. Do you have any questions for me?

APPLICANT: No, Officer. Thank you for your time.
