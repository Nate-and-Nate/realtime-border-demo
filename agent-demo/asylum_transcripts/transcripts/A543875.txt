OFFICER: Good morning. My name is Officer Miller, and I am an asylum officer with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.

Do you understand?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes, I understand.

OFFICER: Please raise your right hand and repeat after me: “I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God.”

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God.

OFFICER: Thank you. Let the record reflect the applicant has been sworn in. And for the record, can you state your name and date of birth?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) My name is Elena Maria Rodriguez and my date of birth is March 10, 1992.

OFFICER: Ms. Rodriguez, you are here today because you are seeking asylum in the United States. I understand you have legal representation. Attorney, please state your name for the record.

ATTORNEY: Good morning, Officer Miller. My name is Sarah Chen, and I represent Ms. Rodriguez.

OFFICER: Thank you, Attorney Chen. Ms. Rodriguez, I have reviewed your application, Form I-589, Application for Asylum and for Withholding of Removal. We will go through the information you provided, and I may ask some follow-up questions. Please feel free to take your time and answer as completely as possible. Are you ready to begin?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes, I am ready.

OFFICER: Let’s start with your background. Can you tell me about your life in Nicaragua? Where did you live, and what was it like growing up?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I grew up in Managua, the capital. It was... complicated. We lived in a small house in a neighborhood with a lot of poverty. My mother worked very hard as a seamstress to support us. My father was… not always around. He had problems with alcohol.

OFFICER: And what about school?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I went to public school, and it was… okay. It was difficult sometimes because there were not enough resources. But I liked to learn. I worked hard and I graduated.

OFFICER: Your application indicates you have a bachelor's degree. Can you tell me where you obtained your degree and what you studied?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes, I have a degree in… in Hotel Management from the Universidad Centroamericana in Managua. It was very important to me to get that degree. It was… it took a long time, but I finished.

OFFICER: What made you decide to study Hotel Management?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I always liked… taking care of people. Making them feel comfortable. Even when I was little, I would help my mother when she had customers. And in Nicaragua, tourism is important. I thought it would be a good way to get a good job and… and help my family.

OFFICER: And what kind of work did you do after graduating?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I worked in several hotels. First, as a receptionist at a small hotel near the airport. Then, I got a job as a… a supervisor at a bigger hotel in the city center.

OFFICER: Your application states that you fear persecution based on your race. Can you explain why you fear persecution in Nicaragua based on your race?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes. It is… complicated to explain. In Nicaragua, there is a lot of… racism. People with darker skin, like me… we are treated differently. People from the Pacific Coast, they are majority mestizo, and they have more power. I am from the Caribbean coast, where most people have African descent.

OFFICER: Can you give me specific examples of how you were treated differently because of your race?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) It was… everywhere. At school, the teachers would sometimes favor the lighter-skinned students. At work, I was passed over for promotions, even though I was more qualified than some of my colleagues. And on the street… people would say things. They would call me names. *Negra*, *mono*… things like that.

OFFICER: Can you give me a specific incident, with dates and locations, where you experienced discrimination or harm?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes. It happened in… in November of 2022. I was walking home from work, it was around 8 PM. I was near the Metrocentro shopping mall. A group of men… maybe four or five… they started following me. They were shouting things… racist things. And then… they started throwing rocks at me. One hit me in the arm. I ran away as fast as I could. I was very scared.

OFFICER: Did you report this incident to the police?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) No.

OFFICER: Why not?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Because… the police in Nicaragua… they don’t care about people like me. They are often part of the problem. They would not have helped me. They might have even… made things worse.

OFFICER: Your application also mentions other forms of discrimination. Could you please elaborate on that?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes. Because… I am also non-binary. I don't identify as fully male or female. In Nicaragua, this is… very dangerous. People are not accepting. I try to be… discreet. I try to… hide it. But sometimes… it is not possible.

OFFICER: How does your gender identity intersect with your race and contribute to the persecution you fear?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) It makes me even more of a target. Being Black, being non-binary… it’s like I have two strikes against me. People see me as… different. As someone who does not belong. The racism is always there, but when they also see that I am not conforming to gender norms, they become even more aggressive, even more hateful.

OFFICER: Can you provide an example of when your gender identity led to a specific incident of harm or threat?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes. This was in… February of 2023. I was at a bar with some friends. I was dressed… how I normally dress. Not very feminine, not very masculine. Just… me. A man started harassing me. He was saying things… insulting things. He called me *maricón*, even though I am not a man. He threatened to… to hurt me. My friends tried to protect me, but he was very aggressive. The bar owner told us to leave. He said he didn’t want any “problems” in his bar.

OFFICER: Did you experience any problems at work related to your gender expression?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes. At the hotel, I was told that I needed to… to dress more “professionally.” They meant that I needed to dress more like a woman. I tried to… to comply, but it was very difficult. It made me feel… uncomfortable. And the other employees… they would whisper about me. They would laugh. I felt like I was always being watched.

OFFICER: Did you try to relocate to another part of Nicaragua to escape the discrimination you were facing?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes, I thought about it. But… where could I go? The racism and homophobia… it is everywhere in Nicaragua. Even in the more… progressive cities, it is still a problem. And I don’t have a lot of money. It would be very difficult to start over somewhere new.

OFFICER: Did you ever seek protection from the authorities in Nicaragua?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) No. I did not trust them. As I said before, the police in Nicaragua… they are not there to protect people like me. They are more likely to… to hurt me.

OFFICER: Why can't you return to Nicaragua now?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Because… I am afraid for my life. If I go back, I am sure that I will be… attacked again. Maybe even killed. The situation in Nicaragua is getting worse. The government is becoming more authoritarian. There is more violence. And people like me… we are the most vulnerable.

OFFICER: You mentioned that the situation is getting worse. Can you elaborate on that? What specific events or changes have made you fear for your safety?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) The government… they are cracking down on dissent. They are arresting people who speak out against them. They are closing down organizations that help marginalized communities. And the… the paramilitary groups… they are becoming more powerful. They are operating with impunity. They target people who they see as… enemies of the government. And that includes people like me. People who are different.

OFFICER: What evidence do you have to support your claims of persecution?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I have… some photos of the injuries I sustained when I was attacked. I also have… some screenshots of hateful messages I received online. And I have… letters from friends who can testify about the discrimination I faced. My attorney has submitted these with my application.

ATTORNEY: Officer, we have also submitted country condition reports from organizations like Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, which document the discrimination and violence faced by Afro-Nicaraguans and LGBTQ+ individuals in Nicaragua.

OFFICER: Thank you, Attorney Chen. Ms. Rodriguez, are there any family members who are also at risk in Nicaragua?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes. My mother. She is… she is old and she is not well. She depends on me. If I am not there to take care of her… I don’t know what will happen to her. That is why I included her in my application.

OFFICER: So, your mother is listed as a dependent on your asylum application?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes, she is.

OFFICER: Let's talk about your travel to the United States. Can you describe how you traveled here and when you arrived?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes. I left Nicaragua in… in March of 2023. I traveled by bus to… to Mexico. It was a long and difficult journey. I stayed in Mexico for a few weeks, trying to… to save some money. And then, I crossed the border into the United States. I arrived in… in April of 2023. I presented myself to immigration officials and requested asylum.

OFFICER: What were your plans when you arrived in the United States?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) To… to find safety. To find a place where I could be… myself. To find a place where I would not be afraid. And to… to work hard and to help my mother.

OFFICER: Given your background in Hotel Management, what kind of work do you hope to find in the United States if you are granted asylum?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I would like to… to work in a hotel again. That is what I know how to do. I have experience in… in customer service, in management. I am a hard worker. I am willing to learn. I think I could be a valuable asset to a hotel in the United States.

OFFICER: How would you describe your English proficiency?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) My English is… basic. I understand some, but it is difficult for me to… to speak fluently. I am taking English classes now, to improve.

OFFICER: What are your plans for integrating into American society if you are granted asylum?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) I want to… to learn English. To get a job. To become a productive member of society. I want to… to contribute to the community. And I want to… to help my mother.

OFFICER: Ms. Rodriguez, do you have any other information that you think is important for me to know in considering your asylum claim?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) Yes. I just want to say that… I am not a criminal. I am not a terrorist. I am just a person who is trying to… to survive. I am asking for your help. I am asking for your protection. I am asking for a chance to… to live in peace.

OFFICER: Attorney Chen, do you have anything to add on behalf of your client?

ATTORNEY: Yes, Officer. We believe that Ms. Rodriguez has presented a compelling case for asylum. She has credibly testified about the discrimination and violence she has faced in Nicaragua due to her race and gender identity. The country conditions reports we have submitted corroborate her claims. We believe she has a well-founded fear of persecution if she is forced to return to Nicaragua. She has demonstrated a genuine desire to integrate into American society and contribute to our community. We respectfully request that you grant her asylum.

OFFICER: Thank you, Attorney Chen. Ms. Rodriguez, I want to thank you for your testimony today. I will carefully consider all the information you have provided, including your application, your testimony, and the supporting documents. You will receive a written decision in the mail. Do you have any questions for me at this time?

APPLICANT: (Through interpreter) No, I don’t think so. Thank you.

OFFICER: Okay. This interview is now concluded.
